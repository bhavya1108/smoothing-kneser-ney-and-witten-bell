876.683044603444
This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances.	910.830523317467
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	147.48570297963855
The next item is the order of business.	6.548144901179936
She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.	3158.8495114107773
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	569.0818202948408
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	2124.4272085320026
Despite yesterday ' s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued. However, the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments.	1085.0479612761128
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed.	1204.7015582989188
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	5.70148027508036
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	451.98137352564123
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House.	240.04663193370763
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law.	313.8891967658002
It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments.	1508.2984214077733
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13.	435.4048315384582
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.	3431.748828576517
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.	151.229635100191
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.	909.1920522174822
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	275.27629622486927
Values should take precedence over power.	233.46916764296088
For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin.	694.368829900479
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners	3086.151091855687
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.	51.94039875907643
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	402.7495349389405
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	13.105368462239369
Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes.	1293.3645412362
Never have the parties been so determined.	4876.196432731784
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	1535.2404857160343
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	123.60263865447136
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.	1861.476755245964
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	35.634964952029186
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	283.08125964006297
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	1697.9536118105807
As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes.	928.2374509746268
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	52.57367808366767
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	1524.6545451667123
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.	2142.9995864136254
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	6158.482110660262
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.	659.414436831734
Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure.	257.69056333103737
Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.	1415.720064567414
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.	1389.520892548869
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population?	891.2271193718454
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?	128.29821851113707
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero?	2064.9059917106115
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.	1113.6423234984584
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.	2615.8889127113684
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.	184.3268883826313
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.	1250.400997511501
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	110.93256268573167
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.	1052.1785410017271
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	724.1516422074566
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	127.32721354010941
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	1400.438531599858
Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour.	2173.3014511172205
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy.	1256.6316851747274
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation.	263.8557516732453
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.	88.30079944879455
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union ' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	57.38154492072116
That is important.	3.4476711996399003
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	696.1455746613842
Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced.	725.8996924461302
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.	1104.762733278856
Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.	910.8613833735257
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard ' .	1074.4207843932593
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.	1174.2091868003963
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service.	376.9131548916361
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	662.6872943026052
The European Commission ' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	417.1163886522054
From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission.	442.21078505403744
In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management.	1498.2900038879322
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.	1083.5248911455608
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	44.57640938966802
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.	3126.533785906063
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	3192.8916370212655
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	152.62455045802542
While Commissioner Patten ' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	766.0552424072363
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	795.7503334674592
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions.	397.27807271848525
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	169.5062199513908
That concludes Questions to the Commission.	3.5820331812248374
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	797.1043472320308
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.	610.6341079206957
We will try to address them, but it is not easy.	131.49245762513019
After shellfish, the slump is now affecting crustacean sales.	2670.3302175213444
In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges.	98.20106546227045
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.	1117.8550726738968
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	79.33889301682679
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece ' s initiative.	1078.436445459966
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency ' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union ' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	52.040735053763306
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	787.407535695908
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	1315.0810253290442
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	108.9369787816517
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason.	982.4645688889202
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	149.000136328748
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.	961.7706221932463
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good.	60.122856946755924
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	260.2021611218491
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.	122.83817725375619
Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million.	2322.346189584342
Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination.	1244.7824812469526
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	162.02984507960028
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	1900.0864645984482
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	2055.9904765737874
Here, Mrs Lienemann, Mr President, we are putting forward here a practical proposal, a common sense proposal, easy to implement, likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies, before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40%!	2210.3510168739754
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.	331.376087101693
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning.	2085.823257640711
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	277.73397226050673
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	1755.5567821189559
We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back.	343.18666052492154
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	718.6151881943221
Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states.	745.3159904914169
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union ' s institutional bodies.	306.4290820672694
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait, led by His Excellency, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister, here in the official gallery.	489.9740946345491
Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.	479.6609600486021
Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.	222.29215629846195
The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.	2254.2670590375496
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	33.62709504496595
With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money.	168.3582355932733
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.	27.42875816909608
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets.	1379.7863018860207
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish.	258.11177409463824
First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society.	923.3683514454685
I shall read it in English, which is the original language of the resolution.	107.92319157806841
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?	613.9920533287557
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	434.9286235098895
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	881.1226621522226
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.	42.67683917922817
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	46.65713770611276
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament ' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	1789.8975455143625
Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble.	265.2711393058655
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	85.39887491823696
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry.	491.3441799458497
I am proud to support such a resolution.	385.0336129500678
Not even Mr Sichrovsky ' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel ' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.	2104.2519599571738
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting.	473.48191562276895
Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council.	847.7103769224275
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	774.7032050323173
In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	281.2164934038507
This is not an option for us any more.	154.82886752988878
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	1027.6541003073423
In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project ' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above.	1446.2673175033156
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible.	560.8978029766917
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	299.6174064553094
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.	1721.4704611919165
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.	168.9461202439555
However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market.	850.5532148016651
Like everybody in this House, I want freedom, justice and security. I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion.	916.6067252941647
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.	304.96607711879994
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.	165.57848528638385
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds.	35.8635358338986
Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment.	1743.9097811632657
My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy.	130.98578429905646
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.	338.4860497383209
If not, why not?	4.2769164654611345
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	693.2429288828522
Despite everything, we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington.	215.27906241481634
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	3618.4374682027797
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	1251.4911870096716
I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing.	686.8060360309839
There have only been nine rejections.	275.25498366343754
In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise.	717.1566975973305
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.	436.71978463035305
That is what we are lacking, Commissioner: the political will to make a start in tackling speculation.	154.3036610665714
It damages Parliament.	650.8324150748655
I was myself a car worker before I was elected.	820.9973081072849
The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic.	4409.431613021881
How do these operate within the European Parliament ' s delegation to the ACP-EU ' s Joint Assembly?	591.6247577855684
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water?	799.8979533960782
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe" ?	918.729590396223
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.	191.63134310423206
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials.	44.277550973341334
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.	205.60635623228848
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.	776.4993445837141
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires.	1669.1434603900618
This applies to every country.	11.73242026709014
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union ' s rural development policy.	454.8476613078641
In theory, we could have done so.	117.04877025005166
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	1342.4977748209883
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	219.91016337630893
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.	683.8847693724728
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique.	1329.676615970734
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	260.1261889412054
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy.	478.70344201967333
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds.	214.08057019292053
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months ' time.	591.0413338553597
I believe that in this context, and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust, it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.	115.07460350228516
In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	584.6419275276811
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States ' policy.	484.87146625202803
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.	3051.329400600221
It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock.	954.5813177364313
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	822.3764245992284
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France ' s at 10%.	1241.4355834827065
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	19.682948741642065
Consequently, neither the Council, the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State.	133.25559998397495
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.	1351.178966990497
Why not?	4.256119963495079
With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination.	3750.8749449988736
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.	458.6805601657841
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	2942.2603252856456
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.	68.04347240121355
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	355.59361417206435
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.	776.2091495800674
My final point is this.	38.17990161648814
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe.	1395.9741031501426
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	302.7757036444252
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	708.9350563759018
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	87.29151555337839
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service.	604.2725635779714
This is true, if we think of Russia ' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	1131.5697835890342
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	2498.7806425984204
Madam President, we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider ' s Freedom Party in Austria, which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part, and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people.	662.7068097563979
Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.	534.0218533160321
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.	103.72700923896554
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission ' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.	579.8010481718982
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	1098.909426016669
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	321.83857035664
But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species.	1343.1991048470948
The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed.	1303.1160814270247
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	1904.4003557889282
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.	214.01562993902186
The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible.	255.8592361794187
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	418.738535484206
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided.	421.0131398116363
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk.	530.9384260301764
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	536.1982209579463
Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union.	628.4988522495862
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	858.1343787590982
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.	208.5612927008551
Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament.	477.0033809770799
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.	496.0572485508392
To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.	375.52537157317494
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	598.0147897590524
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.	1552.5987565437817
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.	674.6541476465095
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	1128.9788935955064
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	593.1853516757913
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	57.81703642392094
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.	1015.3108057480197
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	1439.1628685124278
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	602.5529128694327
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.	297.73783791346483

A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer.	4030.6866611067753
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	480.3077948756089
Questions to Mrs Wallström	295.66577063767454
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	118.70294451361619
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	92.19721232693593
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation.	342.4217456581458
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships ' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.	1937.2418162542185
We can submit motions for this together with you.	562.3958022947303
We do not think so.	3.787348959043925
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	1269.2482197291442
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	759.577744527921
These proposals must include a number of elements, an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies, a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan.	1548.4524103264614
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs.	445.8348865578549
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.	321.5405252088103
This can only benefit our credibility.	65.46150965191922
Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures.	112.93352195147139
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.	1645.2656455462666
It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.	857.1308141176667
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.	506.01668619804053
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered.	2678.750336399423
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up.	426.5765190551808
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me, within the foreseeable future, of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.	863.5498882878024
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	2796.98755458525
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.	1095.1571972392983
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	243.45111429415667
Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs.	229.27472249940348
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union ' s competition policy.	24.720863850251256
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	271.9265925455185
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.	78.02103743642432
However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee.	1358.145324513385
No-one would benefit from this situation.	5.727728083060681
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey 's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	2.937370897346125
However, I would like to insist on certain points.	4.48499773284943
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade.	650.6362739139538
The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.	1298.0149048728806
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	5986.885753038517
Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s.	1250.4111712813544
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament.	15.40099957350986
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now.	238.36746257990515
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	132.75922672751318
Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe.	909.5148922435214
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?	496.5637315012671
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist.	728.6377552393261
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.	613.7657007741535
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	3925.7004595117955
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	4.662629147462896
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	210.2320382488581
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.	2148.1342056991025
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.	2261.2610433293275
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	829.1607071777759
Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy.	494.81073956632065
Madam President, the Socialist Group proposes the following oral amendment.	193.31069667838287
Thank you for your answer.	10.788387728326397
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.	391.07996655539137
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	1078.3515343337674
If you ratify this development, then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union.	613.9094430942564
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.	932.9695974159648
Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth, whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening.	3210.4964189145235
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	618.1723664092108
On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.	269.94682817585215
However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission ' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.	281.9694155337714
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive.	1273.8609053513755
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	4143.379426374729
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.	261.1843087931925
The Commission ' s objective for the next five years is to become a 'global actor ' by showing 'genuine leadership on the world stage ' .	188.38725234642993
. (FR) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment, poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending.	990.4150564964642
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria ' s financial record.	995.933555963154
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis.	332.94223863877016
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers ' in the context of establishing the great single market.	471.8866279876209
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	806.6963146034701
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	2924.027945596634
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	2317.9954406833817
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products.	279.9908507150555
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	46.32154699092937
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.	236.92404944355886
Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey.	402.8194690591126
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.	1262.1021121967185
Corinne Caillaux, who had probably been raped, was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train.	7109.709432312406
In order to generate extra means if necessary, I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors.	490.05350269047864
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	397.15724547792837
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President.	193.16911004854643
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.	767.0266859834592
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020.	122.6226811437217
Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament.	503.3788343626199
They have very little of it.	133.10742639509473
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	4502.189100436865
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	786.7769745865121
Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France ' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay.	576.9119968518877
It is not a lot to ask.	91.464104277926
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	2493.9333126151782
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	88.47267693669767
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	1052.4364131978834
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	1275.4928623310286
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.	1944.263057334386
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses.	513.3012033362962
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.	1555.8587870491274
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	1441.7186471940495
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead.	1302.9746778688525
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people ' s rights to privacy.	606.486524917898
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.	27.735310494251678
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation.	2077.39955424802
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	6.749979684396396
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection.	945.5140425322751
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	2293.4586956448447
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations.	468.9001880538336
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.	633.0806424313845
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	283.0103509739336
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.	2313.8348606705576
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	1397.8492901786872
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	1330.674982115717
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	31.49200450948568
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	1442.3589181302082
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	440.3724315446772
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	359.89250541406625
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	238.23015901367336
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy.	231.71790815367407
Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement.	454.78712516491163
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome.	61.83692673935692
The other question is who should bear the cost.	337.7182183943101
We already have legislation.	51.91731130248996
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.	2006.3702941793335
In my view, it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the Union to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining.	257.78883212052284
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.	557.5495066516802
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.	1021.8497009158872
But the Council ' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts.	906.1371020615406
You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere.	370.3677046636991
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	425.2848317380711
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point.	288.3948352204938
As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports.	791.3012551980228
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	833.3994538456384
One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under.	667.6775120057492
(The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence)	3.2062862829181804
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean.	702.9484457359622
The most important parts of Parliament ' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle.	121.97842773716258
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies.	647.5687972660603
This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union.	194.1945914983094
Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in.	4043.928831590996
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	6285.728528583398
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.	1519.5295822198727
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations ' capacity to cause damage.	1345.4074901776276
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	2066.103815672803
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.	1094.8413497265387
Report (A5-0003/2000) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on	86.30215623600117
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.	357.47432816881746
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	1250.771704823839
On the contrary.	12.24348854938865
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.	1111.4964773904517
Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version.	118.52189878496701
Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want.	2164.9009294778907
We should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which, following the agreement, the European Parliament ' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it.	497.8951446377102
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	298.0527851354139
Madam President, I would simply like to point out that during the procedure, we were not allowed either to table or, consequently, adopt amendments in the Committee.	160.14794060610163
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.	552.8590207201853
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries ' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission ' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	910.2461343694284
Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely.	1707.3415888033169
It has been a useful debate.	33.97992876804003
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.	530.2750599751342
Before the final vote:	105.71782911362943
Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention.	414.2939351016306
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.	1523.2957456585755
Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.	2432.8142419226315
I am waiting for the Commission ' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	269.7357564513194
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.	1363.7795050600168
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	767.2534256242818
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	551.8854095409238
That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment, so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment.	1208.4342163028266
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution.	4433.352463856901
And just as well, in my view.	88.78699027650575
The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.	532.059181662126
These proposals favour women especially.	1665.3341204066442
We must emphasise Europe ' s spiritual history.	461.59073470168465
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council.	782.0977785696252
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	1584.253292718998
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	1620.7910325053292
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	4935.876696713591
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.	340.0245299972944
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.	2519.459971744878
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	1966.9291064887457
In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State ' s democratic process.	975.623109437215
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.8463718256629875
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.	685.5055337101113
At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo.	241.17999095468676
I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening.	1720.3471552244596
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?	1345.5245305006022
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.	2111.4173328275087
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	3009.2894171424236
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good.	80.20368341968101
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission ' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.	495.03556376378896
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.	5.1138554807724965
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	3848.549391096607
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.	332.6546404572664
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	811.3684948638269
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers ' organisations.	2557.6540398908087
One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe.	360.2778960923564
In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product.	1475.9427172543128
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive.	431.6343358553861
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future.	173.16155613076816
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one.	193.95473883556477
Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union ' s budget but the EDF remains outside it.	957.1968094817018
That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form.	1253.0422292115836
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	951.5911866154922
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.	482.3176748713029
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.	1375.4750111340966
Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.	1710.8921155339367
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.	296.6949186957938
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	167.92933444756142
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.	374.6995939078238
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.	603.9845976715877
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure.	1599.7685367934578
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women ' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	759.1500095286895
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.	483.0014348981995
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you.	3020.4614545242134
At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.	617.950132026185
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	113.79521712246584
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe.	282.0394791060116
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission ' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	533.2366586721045
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.	1040.1460121900095
However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens.	159.55160228677465
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.	3869.4036465551794
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.	169.72626702430986
I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration.	678.3213157855519
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	563.5113162940032
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	1162.9732287248376
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	1481.4639953441824
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.	378.9850511985612
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.	4291.0624840472565
Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia.	2248.370147376032
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	250.96292908528923
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	540.0394419807465
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe ' s consumers.	333.03706513383696
That is most certainly relevant.	226.21333752419233
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	1489.1186518237523
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties.	121.10209682563632
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	114.43938120486126
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	831.3871644242649
With regard to Cuba ' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba ' s application.	202.30083523556561
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking.	883.7665444134781
There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo.	100.34204437223059
What has become of it?	335.23885927781896
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	2206.361217997438
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.	841.9252295003306
The polluter should pay.	153.35990895407875
We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner ' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique.	119.78850177356199
Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that.	149.45281295228244
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.	1224.910386984205
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	341.16135762142494
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today ' s economy?	1270.9208742723706
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	777.8519102431887
The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing.	1444.07684533646
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	1848.7141282501125
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	637.3468386437656
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists ' and 'bandits ' ?	1393.6148897666446
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.	605.3433951752996
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	375.61354130186254
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.	975.810509828137
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.	208.01344002699759
As the French say, "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l 'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community ' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.	633.5212904359405
It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.	2508.787743000795
I would ask him to be brief.	7.111415016003416
Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.	336.02673734013905
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?	813.8922661205756
At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas.	159.90862187083573
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation.	696.6357287231157
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	987.4621581714665
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act.	157.5000855503006
That concludes the explanations of vote.	128.11425621750112
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	1277.3677436316166
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate.	97.36637026819784
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else.	2059.199500979738
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level.	716.6327967097656
I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these.	1027.490137378976
As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation.	1141.822794707983
Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe.	420.5049041137027
On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down.	200.01450772499746
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	948.5555466736316
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.	209.6553059646734
We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on.	1029.799158438958
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource.	933.3317421656903
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers.	951.0967315055267
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.	195.56760465020514
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	294.7257478861712
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	174.2902442192089
The principle of specific, exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.	187.19770773244045
Given Poland ' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.	1407.8750255880989
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict.	382.63995560731775
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist!	3155.971130998775
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	443.03106580558716
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed.	382.09747191366137
It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions.	933.5605026525009
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	800.4328978896618
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	272.90106382143045
First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires.	680.8306309639778
Not a euro more or a euro less.	620.0861255058284
Apparently, they were.	651.5491036516738
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.	657.6837507156217
Proposal for a joint resolution on the Commission ' s 5 year Strategic Programme	64.52541533190562
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision.	433.6310961386012
It has to be redistributed time and again.	55.11817768394267
On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion.	703.3726329536827
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	222.41327601105695
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	1831.8240873490722
. (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate.	422.02421792420654
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope, as Mr Patten said just now, that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.	764.4324963075858
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	1991.9854360938707
I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.	295.6658309269828
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	1288.9585228583805
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.	62.62384398029799
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.	1097.6946957819484
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.	627.0336210970879
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace.	510.66253652529906
The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa.	833.8184563402235
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.	922.5406921718851
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission ' s officials, which has been quite excellent.	155.03362315399568
I think that, with this report, we are, once again, one step closer to the realisation of the internal market.	146.1479282365739
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier ' of the Union.	332.4061814314588
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	1584.4864367336252
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.	1719.495132554188
We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky ' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights.	709.9254743177144
Mr President, the Commission ' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	742.1402867072485
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD).	11.47675537610497
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	903.630061878403
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	1060.3489118708535
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans.	64.0755945487839
This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish.	857.4119957547196
And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.	533.8743346415333
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	99.16742404345746
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office.	554.0104801454057
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament ' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests.	73.77500486343337
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe.	655.3531649135101
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	405.93195184594
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	2770.97077313556
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious.	2552.5472155105076
Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it.	934.389657657777
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	4.379762057610637
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria ' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.	831.5274481934325
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published.	580.5836660086441
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.	639.0290146577335
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.	163.7738890300057
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	706.5131531058736
We will cut them off.	194.28609322709778
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility.	280.2013022992593
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	146.00933202283468
At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.	136.6280799072805
We have listened to the Commission ' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation. This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy.	823.9045293002457
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.	114.56425077385754
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	432.15479392248034
If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.	1784.861026981532
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	499.05317362205693
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory.	808.59996298375
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.	125.20748768201331
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	48.32873513887049
Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers ' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe ' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	1476.06269714266
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.	1067.5345989989837
We shall now move on to Question Time.	18.500911688802837
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	1264.8028415105994
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.	55.553644385605196
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.	2609.9955523020985
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.	162.22516986387862
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.	345.62534926275885
That is absolutely crucial.	76.75377661514115
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	2234.4531099052715
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission ' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	137.771810000283
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them.	771.5922116633091
Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed.	34.16975057693968
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.	1375.4272477106997
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.	390.293026863923
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	1095.8201377046225
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	403.3521741281586
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU.	1351.3999756768662
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed.	666.4835992303599
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	130.35099554090854
Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	778.3271622653629
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute ' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.	252.2919955677043
However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.	191.1442182926417
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs?	1154.1948559223733
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.	716.3146389152514
At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified.	777.1894060150684
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	3947.4565970914036
Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block.	287.9327840968715
.	1.3940351656188106
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	188.9821185651024
But for pity ' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	1576.4330238646558
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	332.54067198251926
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people ' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People ' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People ' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	569.8181028071563
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.	724.357863507852
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	644.2444771191916
In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation.	1351.237309993747
In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked.	907.8450335096494
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	27.919898247461386
Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position.	1417.551095279701
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union ' s more remote areas.	219.38964303189925
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.	632.6907015624422
It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, "the brown plague" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory.	1241.0713126832661
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer ' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	377.55084268868546
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	762.9820718279939
For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive ' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject.	1020.1760716340689
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.	2108.1775975410887
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.	564.4507017550307
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.	1560.3136820840612
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	594.1077603393098
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.	1645.2755959534925
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	525.2818303183233
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned.	1737.9137601125049
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	1578.1887881202747
Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.	9.23891137873017
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament ' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	1067.6937110414265
We do not accept this agreement, which deprives people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the European multinationals and banks.	2550.8818539172757
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States.	104.32809759385628
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	2026.7244806202282
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States.	60.48888308304581
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.	54.58942809781616
It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives.	673.1344828294191
Recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Ms Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (11221/1999 - COM(1998) 249 - C5 - 0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)	58.913073704503276
Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition.	383.6081564610066
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.	1038.1054400714902
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?	639.3265000690537
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations.	2221.728003408323
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell ' Alba ' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet ' s memoirs.	1201.0468951010562
As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public.	743.6942633508404
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	90.41247620775572
After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail.	749.1141016736257
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	137.91142119016314
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	757.3237595240944
This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.	107.85156306417304
By now they are far away.	1181.6843358796734
I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things.	792.9329696957932
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	2152.622233661417
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector.	811.9880535684435
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment.	1899.339758276193
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	284.9034683024363
I hope the House will understand that.	312.4859432493294
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution.	827.903098526866
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	882.4380921451522
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.	4115.874449162505
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission ' s guidelines.	464.0632950465091
So I welcome it as such.	992.5098480178103
Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered.	423.51785958881374
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.	611.7688786148369
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.	1308.2007149737437
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	46.892200778056704
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities?	304.1461332715909
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	596.3058029409643
Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament.	227.84697061099388
And therein lies the paradox.	4074.7568094246553
Surely we should be more selective.	153.77668659864497
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.	346.9672673867339
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.	1121.3670911842023
The next item is the report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS).	15.620198349443841
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	2409.6846499264093
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	119.04214128586445
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	277.3212881667304
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	2772.2616828014147
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	900.4828708346315
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality.	1947.0871019518554
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	315.3931125614156
It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences.	324.5637029496956
An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination, and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen, Patten and Poul Nielson.	2364.9531625507375
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	893.3240339931219
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings.	908.4243515080589
It is good for us that we have the power to do this, in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied.	68.73804717702934
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.	458.83867371129946
Have we achieved results?	3584.2795695445798
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	701.1445662670646
Secondly, we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty.	100.64632970312178
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.	1128.8854120169242
Cederschiöld report (A5-0008/2000)	166.53243474835452
Furthermore, the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development.	652.2305164413544
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	2161.2900915203845
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	1094.5192923598242
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water.	142.39158333179387
Yet this is not the situation.	59.30557773648471
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.	777.9525845823609
However, we already knew this.	274.9086484810354
Chancellor Schüssel ' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	4991.908790355909
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	179.67833207429382
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything.	782.4490587724817
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so?	731.4966403187819
During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.	755.8958751865296
Some may be better than others, and some worse.	498.6579098379961
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question.	220.70543106572933
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council.	1032.1459840903715
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.	116.94363524804562
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally ' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women ' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus.	156.14164282709578
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help.	174.39133033997115
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	692.3194703534522
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs.	605.7108193308337
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.	484.28510561097727
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	1305.7064036912875
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.	983.8056403155271
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance ' .	1713.9912375444883
The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension.	2102.871640979841
Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground.	484.74031918338943
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP.	71.51229238387005
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	1516.6976186397003
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility.	2208.303400025488
It is important to remember that.	40.25799529788433
The correct speculative approach, it seems to me, is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos, rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets.	997.1241604781064
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	571.482258702777
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.	372.6605871221368
This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor ' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.	520.1383123414455
The common position stipulates 2006.	45.56689038387443
.	1.3940351656188106
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	736.8633877045191
But what were the Commission ' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	1805.0347730966012
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	482.5238654963689
Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today.	671.4845324835748
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	3.784385649523202
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed.	798.9255393218037
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	25.475923053305387
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	314.9710472138798
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence.	237.51231884556992
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.	5.820666554631243
Mr Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner ' s responsibilities, and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations.	192.80469484122978
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted.	449.8843462015133
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.	820.698149960458
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	584.4181858874183
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	123.84035664144425
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States.	660.5515759768025
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.	668.914566606084
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.	481.2593524040732
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.	1844.0255402627515
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred.	1262.6265116409538
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament ' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved.	261.91717802710485
I am in favour of collection free of charge.	27.985592042726708
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	281.2653699781476
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.	392.0268510346954
Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together.	390.96981200718585
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	1769.6388464215852
(ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war.	1832.6825693708427
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment.	727.3234077091163
If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.	320.31454696427124
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	926.4245729351842
That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far.	163.3994720750038
Thus, whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour ' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same.	1201.2939232784795
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.	815.8925404234258
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity.	289.3582655714528
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	287.0587462337428
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council.	108.91054536278577
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	596.8516063946721
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved.	281.28623945153976
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress.	476.9982236165641
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	485.4326427374882
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	2105.6962154343487
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.	333.3977280674605
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references.	3132.660941231353
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	87.31271915646992
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners.	786.9574034481718
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	1138.477590950982
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.	374.5741244278702
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	259.29896206359007
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	1139.0223185069583
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely.	1138.4563136318707
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	454.5890499500957
My colleagues ' register of interests is complete.	327.7553796822226
Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.	1188.2461490992864
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament ' s modus operandi.	494.37561491663274
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.	1705.9196626139615
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	2899.8169652325405
To do so also changes the owner ' s liability retroactively.	5331.07898005191
Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union ' s Member States?	768.717309058944
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	313.86116282455964
As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards.	1548.233089700426
The Commission ' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market.	88.05002390270015
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief.	625.4619370531371
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements.	1941.99609042364
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption.	717.6976913254766
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	1122.7069071380067
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement.	310.303069480446
This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government.	1079.6940837002965
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms.	1093.9927836082925
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis. Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work.	1858.7057935229398
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.	498.42958245132144
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme.	350.68507988653226
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year.	747.2806037106922
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	172.04845530265186
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	518.497364592167
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	278.778720914142
We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA, and therefore in other parts of the world, and of a sudden rise in inflation.	1250.7289614719027
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.	2769.342456033927
Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences.	2525.2113778817616
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.	1757.6427787192545
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	1324.11490559404
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	1571.2853749838619
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	1319.8269111034617
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority.	162.6559320584918
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne ' s reply.	189.06467884421443
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times.	256.2012831172672
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	1851.100979215588
Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.	2247.202845757025
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease.	166.97860868493055
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	124.17553301515763
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.	156.24445159882933
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU ' s overall agricultural policy.	361.61929139036084
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries.	565.9207065528553
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	442.5157706768245
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.	131.5448652058106
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	165.36687398477244
The general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives.	2508.2967573162364
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	1110.3127734823036
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union ' s common foreign and security policy.	43.63255622402484
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.	586.7595990766971
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	135.6230125396279
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	1469.6518481647322
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections.	203.01897944043242
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	363.3733440651829
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	1453.0095085392481
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	1821.009886458034
Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals.	2352.940369149623
Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	301.5867283645254
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.	482.5090921444861
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	373.590140132515
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime.	936.5138300184694
One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern.	563.0751033133315
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	194.2963893853336
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	790.6155820672352
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	666.5249028862014
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.	1672.783374508146
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):	75.00585115045563
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.	318.17401582970325
Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources.	4180.815101885851
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	224.93033461705647
First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction?	275.99167404337123
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	4876.198188565339
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry.	110.02045753748108
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate.	84.1828209478475
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	368.54270549099783
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmström put it.	1386.6285171896393
It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.	75.74951842521445
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission ' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	268.8223128184275
What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.	694.6654220028057
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.	2130.8927494786353
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.	1054.086186497766
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	1042.11284744589
I now come to the content of the report.	5.024413852893166
Nevertheless, we believe, and I think this is also how the Commission sees things, that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European Union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible. It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession, as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions.	496.9877192181491
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal.	89.16868111338464
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	248.18845623396413
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament 's comments.	493.90998574167776
By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place.	984.7059423209015
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission.	174.4341900004871
The vote will take place on Thursday.	2.8971735747523075
Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century.	705.1754849615387
No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity.	2367.665520100585
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett ' s reaction.	760.6402101085613
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action.	353.69321274778076
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies.	588.5132824844737
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	2936.43368500601
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.	2639.654886866319
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	133.81141176614142
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here.	32.32855193713788
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.	1787.6831467543593
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	223.53835276878618
But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account.	225.7011772183173
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision.	264.72293752741047
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable.	2443.81142766379
It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding.	497.2104124068183
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.	237.27673861286576
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004).	400.99044507431245
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra.	989.133635675713
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential.	92.82780999434794
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations.	257.31084980584444
Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler ' s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative.	1592.7150203531253
What is your opinion on that?	210.56762797021022
More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs.	842.8668378775367
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.	465.8515381530771
Compare it with what happens in December.	220.16787424074667
The postal service is not just for Christmas.	59.81475175338416
I know that this service is unprofitable.	309.3835041350413
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].	8.83308562721914
Madam President, may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry.	1244.8819653864346
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under.	2096.0574215352103
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	137.03098452556537
What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps?	1129.8994535457452
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece ' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM ' s progress towards a United Europe.	1751.7800671753228
We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development.	609.6260133721083
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.	865.1728436678554
This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world ' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively.	1675.6396085451136
I understand the Commission ' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	916.4658626685409
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	208.21462156062228
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.	429.43021813310355
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	184.42627275727565
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.	489.3518748425715
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	1116.9376467364884
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	330.5460500334711
Within the third CSF, this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee.	437.3869506059928
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it.	161.4961922417953
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	413.9853742499666
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	308.98848667175207
This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs.	536.1197203554992
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services ' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	880.8300248795036
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes.	95.66528204785583
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?	541.2738226331916
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	3419.3215592326483
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	1371.6141237037548
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	1171.8407208627748
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.	872.4972643869107
There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information.	293.3349366326857
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	537.4753456426515
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive ' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business.	505.12009618678917
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	366.68018060092515
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is.	1382.8947497198826
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	2180.756537183049
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.	1507.5080927347426
To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one.	2863.505261978009
We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets.	669.4723603983565
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen.	511.6920443180239
Amendments Nos 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions.	391.3529789817396
Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs.	2119.40600150237
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together.	1206.038959904449
In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy.	146.78451875801076
Is this possible?	68.35452562120939
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission ' s priorities in the field of transport.	108.2679720928838
This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO ' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	315.2593283113326
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.	2704.684022655373
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	2836.081305332281
