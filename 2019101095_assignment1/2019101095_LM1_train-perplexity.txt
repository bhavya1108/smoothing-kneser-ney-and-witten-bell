3.9466245082446556
I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie.	2.9429066734253673
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.	4.766503217040779
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	3.6075779569143713
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	5.665133403864792
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	4.37357133789267
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	2.8758243342110203
Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients.	3.3402540287574105
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.	3.5595055932288306
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.	3.8014543417163353
Absolutely, I do not think that will pose a problem.	2.9674637459509765
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	4.5829591786056545
In any case, the Council ' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime.	4.019307778082139
However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.	4.25300982329548
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event.	2.4873569623231986
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	2.8766632434875343
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens ' Amendment No 105.	4.322998432526073
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.	5.173369858234525
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament ' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	4.595013800125954
The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union ' s and the European Parliament ' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction.	4.525719154206327
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week.	3.363363821969226
I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much.	4.374930212450459
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency.	3.406390529990645
Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency.	5.502952166557919
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	4.1186875140268455
However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected.	4.0956244105975825
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe ' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood.	4.290940784679448
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue.	4.3643056518005805
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni.	4.223486343562581
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	3.6015022341885077
The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States.	3.5451899124673076
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one.	4.5906561282381695
Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives.	3.425197496820325
And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people ' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.	3.72021033887734
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio ' s reports.	3.7545829880403008
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	4.491224798024801
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture.	5.360642977036518
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	3.703758439418374
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	4.318973166290407
The European Parliament ' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation.	4.320229096193003
That, too, is a step forward.	2.4690481185144844
This is the challenge.	3.922577919896569
We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions.	3.9140804292591196
Many speakers have underlined this.	2.514106833243275
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	4.156723754041049
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO ' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.	4.685651061723607
I hope that Parliament 's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place.	4.61367732075007
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission ' s liability as an institution.	5.68757475116732
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline, I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000, as set in the common position - must now be moved forward.	3.737262841585997
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during the Asian crisis in 1997, as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993, everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation, particularly currency speculation.	2.9012278603167774
A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation.	3.611610885772442
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" .	2.6534260404574956
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	2.076572223121467
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo 's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies?	3.921057874847648
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	5.518233019252084
The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse.	3.731023679570604
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.	3.8624305900538283
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections.	3.6697276583186134
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works.	3.6899126476421404
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	5.020852011199692
But if we are to secure the public ' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	3.833392063133611
Please excuse this very legal answer.	2.969681961009904
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.	4.575392174253678
Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation.	2.557299481327065
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	3.6071102964308697
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.	3.6079090084094796
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do?	3.876270380805777
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	4.120875256241499
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted.	4.4949227291251335
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	3.4978594048295917
In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights.	3.159474611658322
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.	3.9673123174596014
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.	4.021018214078184
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	4.083141528391136
The United States ' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers ' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	5.218254815260538
The proposals in Mrs Theato ' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.	4.318818496212762
In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States.	2.8732192927324154
For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children ' s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries.	3.9157119902246857
The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU ' s treaty concerning the manufacturer ' s liability.	4.533186144908708
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	3.1105547693096187
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN. I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament.	4.312623665474777
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	4.7395020959130125
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	4.981429419841194
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre ' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States ' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important.	4.114316528422083
So our response must be rapid and strong.	3.7467319809456203
Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.	2.9127160877983242
Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing.	3.69930009010332

The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.	4.8384219059351254
By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine.	3.306228383825542
All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	3.949326542784806
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.	3.874781094635531
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	4.094233801763509
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo ' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors.	4.011057656724813
Mr President, as others have done, I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced.	4.117580140639278
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.	3.1833668441469216
Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future.	2.6840389614640054
These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully.	3.3661929490002653
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.	4.285891086417616
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point. This was just a procedural motion.	3.794696465525348
In any event, the Bureau will consider your suggestion.	3.4281354147106256
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission 's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.	5.1560060996973425
In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament.	3.6301569303196715
Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late.	3.6584611326046668
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	2.8243372139782497
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.	5.196618621072657
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	4.665756783217606
If not, why not?	4.2769164654611345
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	4.457735370472832
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	3.0021936227576838
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	5.349196145888632
Thank you, Mr Murphy.	3.132708271683178
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	4.541337827636854
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate.	4.124202677510482
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction.	3.4313307383030622
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	3.265401820749791
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	5.306946555846419
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	4.447299742093048
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices.	4.96661098368507
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.	3.114460480951247
The form the aid takes is important.	4.728712490354035
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.	4.887081109377729
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system.	4.399165259317796
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	3.035431133824531
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.	3.0211538065915904
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	4.576950064210564
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	3.855371143454468
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152.	4.47024957066509
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament.	3.4651726514989254
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.	3.672779999715066
In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case.	3.0994531066805404
Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels.	2.537791507591672
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	2.647824139682015
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	3.574537408257168
On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law.	2.3203095143013606
From this point of view, the common position is weak.	3.8573019707400245
The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union ' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations ' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	4.546588801486405
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens ' greatest problem.	3.6961214338571247
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen.	3.486644915285089
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments.	3.6611899564828714

The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised.	5.138119933299333
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	3.6952431789672895
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	3.633897319142829
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.	3.5701936003778045
We need public and private investment.	5.126574987086243
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions".	3.0379290844195483
The applicant countries ' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems.	4.469688212471764
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission 's practical commitment to that.	3.3680946859666574
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	3.611334236692439
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December.	3.7330606206776675
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism ' and 'superstate ' are not mentioned at all.	3.680597922738518
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.	6.509082561175956
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	5.750304120609981
In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein.	4.225476680669686
Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible.	3.450632568481319
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	6.071286483749945
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit.	3.5360860653789334
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	4.210388509270433
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system.	4.153982113614197
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.	7.405097870003256
The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced.	5.469984311754698
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	3.253721607376927
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	3.2331948795148016
Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)	3.7208853445484253
The next item is the report A5-0039/2000 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland, with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS).	2.6908984625419463
People are especially wary of GMOs.	2.7195024418591753
And these are the consequences!	5.1550212447973065
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days.	4.23193587719416
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	4.840754629040143
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	3.9732440532161215
For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service.	3.430924307313241
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	3.294767299170964
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	4.5321020075348235
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal.	4.253199858468838
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.	5.170766054629916
In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping.	4.837962800409792
Are we doing enough?	3.1347776285039535
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet.	4.996462042724418
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner.	4.823265066770584
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7.	4.64386231883858
He stated: "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance."	3.584035902480729
We in the European Union are one Community.	6.235290431339719
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe.	2.846483548727691
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully.	4.455842175925473
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM ' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM ' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	3.756464551347191
Madam President, I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri.	3.970984605543944
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding ' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	3.468221127171959
It will also continue to fight for Member States ' acceptance of this.	4.962094430405571
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position.	4.725109338242861
However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute.	4.2475079698863345
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	6.0323208188196515
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.	5.39639128785137
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.	5.155036020848278
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable.	3.84471044533199
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	2.8473343766813795
Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota?	2.9309419420786202
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.	4.124089859809686
Mr Di Pietro ' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	3.62261858148544
However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.	5.019235052400654
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.	3.2138473506691376
The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105.	2.6064643762509294
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	6.041555841894283
Having listened to the Commissioner just now, we know that the Commission ' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no ' to the Tobin tax.	4.06549571977582
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.	3.602288353377922
I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so.	4.4118332073077635
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	3.8112329944690413
When will you make it compulsory?	3.963667067515235
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	4.270588992122338
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.	2.6597954055979853
When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions.	3.4744436934937233
In the case of Turkey it is different.	3.8453306811354055
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	3.593969933054028
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	6.092931450962849
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.	3.87256872204393
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland ' s only Objective I region.	4.060022125506044
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.	2.625910690921837
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	4.919830663120755
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon.	3.236743296333648
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.	4.76222039354634
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	3.6184979410898475
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.	3.689470999571412
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	2.9326805525191864
Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?	3.3789730616342086
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired.	3.739056945432521
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	3.50377529702296
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	4.0934633043934925
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	3.6388724618406862
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	3.3333498615734842
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?	4.674909783751766
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	4.9246757513543695
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	4.04237105203374
Here too there is at least some progress.	3.293137902803998
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	3.4489223116729155
This is no longer tolerable.	2.9943534408868597
I would like to say, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, that in its judgement of 5 October 1999, the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer, which was approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and, specifically, with its Article 9(1), which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated.	3.8463904501609094
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.	5.613660427076096
What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing.	3.598123963839837
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	3.1399620604960594
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.	3.575638680811864
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.	3.310712714689228
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination, which I have just mentioned, and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, by this Parliament, especially from the point of view of coherence, recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause.	3.9286560097969816
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière ' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission ' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	3.7954818615599164
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament ' s participation in it.	3.411835225218197
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)	1.8435763830220249
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want.	4.521463661093263
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	3.7370268774199285
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	2.6475562515394113
But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us.	4.339476209470705
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain.	3.426090939370776
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	4.06882907464164
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.	5.53765547275265
Parliament has completed the agenda.	2.6583697240186437
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.	4.2524198836041585
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted.	3.94193067053761
We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.	4.311497360587203
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies.	3.636245492242032
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.	5.7204158976795405
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars.	3.349402140787992
Additives in feedingstuffs	2.3128091995702387
It should continue along this path.	4.905861357533399
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez.	2.382594377235495
The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year.	3.8690587971507027
Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling.	3.128304678081953
I feel, at any rate, that for the ultimate application of LIFE, at least, there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment.	4.964802108509277
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.	3.093235184082091
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	3.608775684720262
It naturally has to support these negotiations, sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency, within the powers of the European Union, is positive.	4.341063470345634
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	4.227141648701971
As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities?	3.5645867039583656
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure.	5.787389635474932
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	3.8816671828536258
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.	3.191881777828475
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.	3.207140596972171
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.	4.467833362400156
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament ' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims ' families.	3.8521174885374645
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union ' s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.	4.484780302949127
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?	3.0796923628570947
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	3.661622166787843
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.	3.889036092781212
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.	3.7245130579820946
On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.	2.8255509209677045
But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies.	3.143535345301242
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state ' s tax revenue.	3.942602870025623
The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC).	3.2775149701762523
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	4.291190949287721
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament 's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament 's other amendments has been retained.	5.118374187419128
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	4.466399032253152
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets.	2.9860965908434993
We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution.	4.41474417932244
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	5.541116531115426
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.	3.1814040885603148
Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually.	2.697908773459398
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	4.169722773452491
Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer.	3.0643078983197527
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	4.314002843679356
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	4.575370805508218
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	3.9462138942854694
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned.	4.065655719796253
To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks.	3.262603433692485
Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage.	2.3944855481901564
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.	3.328410112314775
What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function.	3.866803247104212
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	4.089969617777675
The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules.	4.511451906795861
A communication later this year will give full details.	3.7961452300229226
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote.	2.79442981105834
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round.	4.172025019324949
Regarding sustainability indicators, the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue.	3.2497191773208756
Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.	4.064984811550931
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.	4.198009289388416
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	3.6068430594520318
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations.	3.3213551607909193
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	5.233558723283544
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.	4.42641676857504
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.	4.004724685702294
In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	3.1676399329555154
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.	4.3684762114818
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers ' clutches is the cost of transport.	3.9984339468312857
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive?	4.664008576369537
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress.	3.7189220275444232
It will be there for some time to come.	4.432170538656888
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	3.338899114612288

The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today.	5.4147769850029235
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	3.734647256087178
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.	4.964044872283592

I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.	4.30112391465584
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world.	3.539238817492466
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).	4.645280055363032
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity.	3.9394167611170743
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	4.726587992428164
To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it.	3.679126166621953
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	3.7714660017580006
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report?	3.7792927439663933
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	4.250345097882945
An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity.	3.1828614696763733
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices?	3.26470668276607
Why are there no fire instructions?	3.362627686238641
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.	3.447790740499858
In the past the British Conservatives ' double standards have brought the United Kingdom ' s House of Commons into disrepute, and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament.	4.17639076441912
.	1.3940351656188106
On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	3.856834696607721
One of the EU ' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners.	3.6034457995273708
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	3.858221460262693
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	4.527025689950243

The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	4.680535635083808
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	4.436860606818556

We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.	4.675236204762046
What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union.	3.3333080676733324
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.	4.8683191975354685
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with.	4.049296116025467
Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment.	3.095150795876121
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	1.9475027949088681
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	3.6145752465674175
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	4.1186780266756235
Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	3.521294645858953
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report should be implemented.	3.9366093590400397
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	4.492507124284856
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	5.573229020880566
In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries.	3.2070024806885384
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country 's needs, but also of its policy performance.	5.000798956666769

The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures.	3.2576010887737263
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky.	3.967072561284847
The truth is though, that the Commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	4.524430728806404
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner ' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia ' s problems, but more particularly Serbia ' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	4.018236683276817
The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.	5.018467992550908
The cast is always the same.	5.360455991451459
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.	4.122552414916799
This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings.	4.374702531530558
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	3.6352808941235097
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	3.27844970221477
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	4.4652363041973535
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.081684619817497
Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements.	3.8761697415317182
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group ' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support.	4.159838839439866
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables.	5.983000567596073
In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs.	3.6704103420369796
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.	4.032630074657143
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	3.758213572935372
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	3.436868024628176
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	4.671518922401782
Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.	3.4759013463135116
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	3.566798915614635
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products.	4.888001111745496
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer.	4.8327878038748935
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.	3.9348558398384537
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action.	3.9494941769947873
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.	3.437539890930762
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	4.572247035539208
Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.	3.6218444301628163
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	4.815042479313964
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture?	3.0063942400581527
And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines.	4.521386699257745
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future.	3.7979013019576207
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.	4.352808682744689
Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.	3.718734933083406
It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner.	4.575756051832339
The real world simply does not work like that.	4.4630242090440255
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.	3.6016485944057335
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector.	4.427829917321071
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.	3.883005813769672
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	4.3713419268656075
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services.	4.37333835352625
For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement.	3.533890544025558
Commissioner, we must be consistent.	5.862256271705119
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.	3.6387727864614723
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	4.7359402955384375
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.	5.631811343681334
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament ' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	5.135415658913895
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms.	3.028829182937801
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	3.683888048480541
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	4.299703609799115
It is for life.	4.11111127774447
This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people ' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared.	3.985867350955325
Action must get under way immediately.	2.669792092557366
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid.	4.4032680697816735
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	4.778437718344728
ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned.	2.543410739728668
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	4.086148220239571
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	3.1424627311326603
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.	2.9198402290123284
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture ' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world.	4.095212476768073
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	4.812065900367842
But what then instead?	4.444930165647863
The Commission ' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware.	6.953629659701251
The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.	4.492775730987066
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of?	3.3829590827219573
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure.	4.591797472965298
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals.	4.120338888205964
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management.	4.020687824691134
That is not correct.	2.9970097314424833
Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail.	4.167185925475968
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	4.352579834451901
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	4.205567618353784
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.	4.071703264877622
. and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	3.8374033600398003
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.	4.149390978383493
We therefore support Mrs Lienemann ' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals.	3.0228447988013425
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.	4.070666098087093
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.	5.803142587116435
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.	3.4453684012550445
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	1.989084347219329
They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.	3.747788504110679
In today ' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious.	4.379513613042773
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	4.060976407958734
In more general terms, this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants.	3.903103283505641
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	3.1609751881815296
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable.	5.352190199684054
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks.	4.969678827311352
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty ' s treatment of the right of reproduction.	3.920161190093955
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.	3.9689705859317526
They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties ' commitments under the agreements.	3.347117978275133
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	3.458346615145399
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	2.4856364800165824
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	3.2418197394576227
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	3.64241567104777
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	4.438210965183795
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one ' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.	4.0085335799311395
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples?	3.392502511822876
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	3.448503359329019
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.	2.854323421526121
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy ' .	3.7400208308820235
This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.	4.940853899663863
However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.	3.4469728069848182
Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	2.5829698308039077
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital.	3.5248406305315507
This is totally unacceptable.	3.986670321346523
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?	3.514171763468551
Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	3.562220670967388
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right.	4.38144113519833
I am aware of the Commission ' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	4.221290650269116
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.	2.941591173657596
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set.	3.8697987244006566
I will give some examples shortly.	4.65114266669302
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet.	4.748663662232344
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.	4.393299510033293
The laws against racism must be harmonised.	4.741951983386242
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.	3.046713492745756
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission ' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	4.819972510779906
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service.	8.077750193598371
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	3.386861235419828
She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras.	4.541148204140532
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union ' s goals.	5.695927000473981
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor ' s book.	2.801236731528843
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.	3.697803259660189
Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning.	5.4109891446648
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	3.2687298576019326
Mr President, at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt, our rapporteur.	4.155602377562205
	1.0363974359942942
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	3.015717044741552
We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.	4.866044477553744
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	4.074836674497267
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	4.487468590284336
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question.	3.3713439794514284
Thank you, Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council.	3.13214130705807
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	3.8885695186193603
However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints.	4.154075207171223
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	3.642261979774712
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.	4.40679615010864
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	3.9089846636812395
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.	2.9813905004533234
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	3.997692373385003
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi ' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.	4.134891213736798
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens.	3.6085547826580395
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner ' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.	4.140778421413257
In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.	4.19399999414566
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?	5.067960867457352
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.	3.7977141771122525
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.	3.529040636323191
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration.	3.659608321065386
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	5.397695511086265
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	4.3758475163433666
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	4.5315019474778
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	3.3941295117148838
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.	3.7881412533070917
I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group.	5.313121553973033
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.8463718256629875
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	4.464606885750851
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	2.717590607668196
As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation.	5.339146353348093
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	3.0840029712501105
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.	4.812590285320685
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	3.8572905485707127
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	3.449602186984558
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.	4.266700840481608
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	3.095701876246562
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance ' ?	2.7006518558143893
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.	5.392129789422937
I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin.	5.327199662069195
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union.	3.714064668031155
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.	4.0581776699132845
That surely is in everyone ' s interests.	4.099891638744988
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	4.766284570574709
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.	4.511989415858404
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	4.1439337127735785
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	4.937218195457361
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	3.804110561108634
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I have therefore voted in favour of it.	4.392387974609577
I would urge Parliament to support them.	5.013370103424301
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.	3.5969443197669255
Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless.	3.4821395898070753
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about.	4.550070308367532
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform.	5.095830392368322
Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission ' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable.	4.183563437108019
. (DA) The Left ' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today ' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers ' diplomatic sanctions against Austria.	3.4512920733693546
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me.	2.8703433110935723
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.	6.786746747958496
At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries ' own policies for reducing poverty.	4.1444488635231105
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	3.26472667988313
Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice?	4.041693305852963
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	4.180621509491979
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes.	3.7545011785972657
As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States.	4.090312743617223
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say, and I think that they are right, then to take up another six months of the Commission ' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible.	5.079650971252915
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.	3.666434803145464
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments.	3.232628879214376
So far there have been no infringements of the law.	3.782711295179374
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):	2.574230902440121
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.	4.538099869974792
As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	3.728253871161498
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	4.461735288436182
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	3.5883616782567844
Is this simply a political gesture?	3.636143993387549
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	6.008157868219082
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	4.226290724259444
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.	5.020711013020002
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS.	3.4424707556847562
My apologies once again for my mistake.	4.275692367413625
We estimate that the Commission ' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	5.095853800267893
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.	4.193982955413217
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	4.510864512537509
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings.	5.179922633500114
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	4.04172981406859
On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction.	3.0279043755906905
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.	5.2727451194446715
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples.	2.8129269950127114
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.	3.5550843952147457
I am surprised it has even been made, because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents.	3.776940944858092
However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States.	3.682900888707315
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006.	3.896196531449227
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated.	5.957357409910173
This would then give us, for Wednesday ' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights ' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs.	3.6872619190112386
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.	3.9205487304054816
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.	4.827115671497956
With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.	3.8616472130861292
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	4.331897992341549
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.	3.478438697085148
We do not know what is happening.	2.8964488318009116
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	4.931215394583433
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	4.48942798168425
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.	3.497614126318332
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.	5.296765974644304
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	4.042408479530106
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU.	4.934036192802655
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	4.543068426841927
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements, which we must solve.	4.971463875914443
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.	3.672914806866895
Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union.	4.126169286963644
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal ' s point of view.	3.1648728068362133
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis.	2.3709984126612955
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	3.3850167291074875
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	3.1197577217673125
The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	3.8269772622072353
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	3.2694329305950673
In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	4.783596441601619
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible.	6.685454171087147
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola.	4.701192409175042
If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere.	4.8414087492346125
(The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence)	3.2062862829181804
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.	4.638386750406713
Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject.	3.255032073776747
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.	3.794898938972988
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	3.0796035545918565
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	4.009075576623762
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project.	4.156481779046101
If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made.	3.7631808523973067
To grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of Europe, it is worth pointing out that in my own country, Greece, a country that attracts tourists, over the past four decades, during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over-concentrated in the major urban centres, the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed.	3.777790129905705
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	3.5862194294364396
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.	3.889534191927869
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal.	4.449763453379153
One of the very first speakers, Mr Wuori, spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel.	3.451253038375565
Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.	3.8289572151084696
The Committee on Women ' s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education, because according to official figures women account for 53% of those engaged in tourism services, and in parallel, they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change.	3.525603551596239
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.	4.0502140135039015
Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur ' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire.	3.803997609895563
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000.	3.3675856707675167
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses.	4.3634568979681285
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba.	4.496941103417566
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.	3.6504479358289412
That concludes Questions to the Council.	3.54089732153413
There are also courts in Karlsruhe, London, Lisbon, Dublin and Edinburgh.	3.019429064173106
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.	4.553431448793362

In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	4.046184760341407
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	2.578255549164177
, rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report.	3.4860129549262124
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women ' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	4.031492670693862
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo 's motion.	3.491331711321057
VOTE	1.083590840144401
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here.	4.392849517788865
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.	3.9710910258868815
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference?	3.2132291816865086
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?	2.2688574237046777
I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer.	4.599029619739347
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House ' s work and perhaps by going down the same road.	4.421746750188842
When I read the report and see the picture of the EU ' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture.	4.708013817228714
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive.	5.887062998064254
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.	3.5564997684010073
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	4.528042611784556
As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	4.040724955833982
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	3.952769249874255
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter.	3.674741835933413
That appeared in the communication published last July.	4.441940696387978
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not.	4.063924890146219
That too is feasible.	3.648159099333788
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	3.7593341428468423
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate.	4.01513102161107
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.	4.731131803653376
That would be a similar situation.	4.40941489176785
Middle East peace process (continuation)	2.4852319610435125
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.	4.290275964103844
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.	5.445221483532103
This is not in question.	4.120552019294989
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	5.614484446893555
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	3.347447322248461
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.8143819275036557
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area.	4.223778531654335
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	5.317188433487012
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	1.1272086066868192
And now the Erika.	4.050349542098553
That was how it was.	3.8704795788920827
However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States ' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.	4.740308403125773
Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments.	4.553264656973256
Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.	3.85195882529282
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.	4.705528636901697
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.	3.663164358326041
If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!	4.343401988585913
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	3.5897718106530387
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro.	3.861292528894987
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before.	4.853514242845405
Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin.	4.123275182373163
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	5.711725932911695
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy.	4.110722974749832
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	4.043120665258813
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.	4.326024076403019
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering ' s lack of logic.	2.681665460218625
One of the EU ' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	4.264080635180114
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	3.6133416013438184
In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village.	3.997933835451194
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	3.638955029739554
Bluefin tuna is the world ' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons.	3.528695286476062
We await a proper response from the Russians.	4.761631651145796
This is not impossible.	4.432220284162032
With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission ' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000.	4.367808630691813
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.	3.593658415279045
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all.	4.161446125818833
In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas.	3.2598325183822117
In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries.	3.1415492971528667
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit.	3.73256196889845
In 1988, the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men.	4.190978111979554
It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis.	3.9597590439634325
Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.	3.6557046638761657
Mr President, today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.	3.866248856876598
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened.	2.622944620833115
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" .	3.838110415031621
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.	5.057325320907004
There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	4.191676787240278
- (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party.	3.6286456756320398
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out.	4.246196142892983
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned.	3.6576422262954615
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.	4.32368024103983
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	3.125491102578694
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework.	4.505625510778124
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.	4.078506745274139
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.	4.012537712253346
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	3.8500057611572296
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.	4.1261727383327536
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people ' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	4.043221447803445
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.	4.34486404772512
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.	4.0810226745729485
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	3.8825251621012917
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.	4.624211651175635
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities.	3.657507050365831
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	3.7041740878838354
My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too.	4.499328542228099
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.	3.6679612222368845
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	3.725449539177147
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage.	4.405023981433503
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.	5.044489885128807
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union ' s development policy.	3.0219403670353078
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period. This is not very good at all.	4.747411568993762
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade ' (page 4).	3.2393690928846723
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years.	4.065452450463787
The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement.	4.4689555649213215
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	4.664770939386649
How many people found work?	3.3416002446801087
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".	4.401923535124346
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	3.3403951639257405
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.	2.6392910202252082
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	3.2114922541446904
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.	3.7263211352583325
It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned.	4.504578080821524
The tourism market is by definition a flexible market; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light, with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work: remember that 50% of employment, especially in southern countries of the European Union, is done on the black economy.	4.156913165452427
My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have?	2.9872116203339356
The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament ' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers ' liability.	3.4631379011317995
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.	3.8620764049795127
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds.	3.885501519773656
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.	2.649393822753365
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.	4.214135457714321
There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers.	3.3615731515887397
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	5.035964167184705
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us.	4.141216312103711
It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy.	3.448516485013958
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.	5.625525771004963
We must give them this opportunity.	3.6257260420017645
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy.	4.688011768036574
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.	4.369934279338396
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading.	3.372476374770147
There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies.	4.884997318890747
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	4.01406039977285
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	4.347880559985196
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament ' s opinion next month.	5.180955420826596
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned.	3.917983351135534
Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.	3.408039533665755
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter?	5.197463499258603
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	5.301793172133523
This is key as regards the future of this issue.	5.863311903838603
There is time.	4.096049953677411
Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies.	4.463865925150788
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations.	4.331340828905414
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	3.541300192186389
That is our duty.	3.862460171824262
Up until now, the Commission ' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	3.246500166042836
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	3.679163632342154
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	3.963597759222318
The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation.	3.6616447302364548
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
. Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services.	4.02311716264586
The attacks against Austria ' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	4.130355622003412
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget.	3.798749277989085
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.	2.892312585724106
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	3.8070238672907277
It did this as well.	4.15484674220404
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.	3.606551885398705
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	4.337802118106239
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council.	3.1547315786860355
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	3.69017718886533
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks.	4.568216948494207
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé.	4.697841455455797
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	3.927133247532284
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	4.957955065330967

Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment.	3.040710945136231
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	2.9539925141096757
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.	3.5909969079591453
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	4.096535850386037
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level.	4.113742697723444
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with.	3.321441897240515
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition.	3.488919972709239
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	3.701678400311095
By pitching the percentage level at 5%, which is now likely to be the case, it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage.	4.238990296124224
However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	4.0434886398901035
The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.	3.769041856406824
Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.	4.354105739758987
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.	3.7243340967034717
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure, so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism.	3.9035145667814652
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.	4.187714255584619
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure.	3.6834979319646397
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears.	3.6911089541772384
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen ' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared.	3.1265016354493937
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.	2.711600925543175
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	6.068477746979329
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?	3.308683733577574
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	4.156682609835569
At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread.	3.8795755232398035
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth.	3.7406477912048244
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.	3.6210493762170453
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	2.903018279761778
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test?	3.365113552194787
Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles.	2.738420156849207
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.	4.77152965390309
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	3.2454903760381044
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.	3.1516673502139354
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	3.7480139146047002
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	4.519094778862209
One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources.	2.3634513330466147
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	4.429902460106815
Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons.	3.768611150426371
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.	5.829670010794875
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.	5.027438448219394
Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union.	3.1475990148822275
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	3.417447954276181
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition.	4.5125169045491855
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.	4.1940601572503
.	1.3940351656188106
The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain.	3.9695687126286754
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	2.8523329836434974
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.	4.060291428183363
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal.	5.610130780997805
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK.	3.4423231459431833
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members.	3.1142472716729523
VOTE	1.083590840144401
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	3.4063491774833348
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	4.098766491059019
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.	4.448406427942003
Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.	4.1472277332492
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.	2.8858218228527535
Who will provide us with new jobs?	2.982316942407549
Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers?	4.153875384152604
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?	4.201579874919804
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.	3.6161213386464923
As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.	4.099549762385837
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance ' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	2.9929038217745902
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.	5.143322770179009
If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.	5.151356857342637
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.	4.322729156376213
However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency ' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts.	4.724748081020387
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.	3.784353660107994
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	4.011966357343086
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	3.793279084085907
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	4.316290517197607
We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee.	3.805644021856334
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	4.6991464922018835
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.	3.9641479628893967
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty.	3.6920305141172842
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	3.6419473814504815
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.	5.094888861143749
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen 's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy.	4.5522161976109485
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	3.6415970961189843
Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here.	4.615303627677627
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987.	3.836992755876077
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating.	4.941043154880325
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now.	5.831691579231851
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?	2.731933012179996
Is this speculative?	3.7365181339773033
. (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council.	3.4298887212393967
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	5.456679046009019
Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough.	7.39901705844916
The company went under despite this.	4.698620527158872
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner?	3.6815305843096042
Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria.	3.1354522099096154
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people.	3.2553525378658312
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility.	4.581011909892639
It will reflect the European Union 's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	4.962007060022268
On behalf of the House, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament.	5.427533785174308
The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost?	4.4243566416641675
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	3.683665884201128
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	4.376505987311794
We have to act now, before it is too late.	3.430443177865141
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.	3.7986233677906576
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	4.223237274063386
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.	3.799328775311105
We are badly behind now in this matter.	3.4449412624976494
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.	5.535604066186945
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.	4.081283621060625
With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs.	3.8374882996515325
We must not forget that people working in tourism, especially women, encounter particular problems such as seasonal work, the need to renew contracts from one year to the next, social protection, lack of interest in continuing education, and reduced possibilities for development.	3.225445890902003
In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion.	3.8650222732433526
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.	3.7681633842244433
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax, such as the Tobin tax, as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation, so to speak.	3.88686522221206
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number.	5.067405150131076
As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries.	4.006046634482437
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	3.6845268146356713
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	5.048949569404265
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	4.115382270278218
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	4.138072595103811
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	5.897524925759905
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment.	4.300582506598559
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.	3.8840031787651275
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	3.5174830247943314
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	3.71428479223729
Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one.	5.94466166438966
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	4.205845840773774
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	4.219402628087872
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.	4.244762756717979
Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution.	2.607642597679382
There, the border question is obviously central.	2.868614743106442
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	3.1790179292675456
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.	3.8613246680178244
How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan?	4.062406616979955
Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions.	3.035340125517917
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.	4.343857745220291
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.	4.215693029024212
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection.	5.199288948703015
They are already having implications for resource availability.	3.616711845291897
We are right to blacklist Haider ' s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination.	3.490323618826961
This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.	3.356399177509758
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States.	4.271151700217247
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	4.219914680210377
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies.	4.615956095926706
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.	4.476413424093332
The European Parliament and the Union ' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia.	3.5539140420482025
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.	2.755971540691981
It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive.	3.551515719833839
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	3.9639721527850167
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.	4.608893693334843
The Commission?	9.462664151954195
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this?	3.3974702670316597
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.	4.355901337138576
This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation.	5.5547053373256805
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms.	4.321082803837773
Native Americans in the US - Dineh	2.9962247605483627
Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view.	3.947343010486326
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.	4.466658447039653
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.	3.399144793503515
Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent.	3.6073312976715695
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	4.900581268747121
As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.5998169599467023
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.	2.250914240529634
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.	4.027922094728089
That is the goal which we have to work towards.	5.35361934360467
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	4.385154194085869
The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up.	3.9168356168133567
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again.	2.841980697283972
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People ' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	4.3315041840836725
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.	3.5456830043018597
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention, which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today: a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect.	3.9398828107947703
Mr President, permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel, who is a member of the ÖVP executive, that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider, and that we wish to denounce you for doing so!	3.8365295088307243
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	4.086807921858889
You may draw your own conclusions.	3.706003277481529
In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.	5.003019988593057
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid.	4.15981147185772
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	3.4332784539495336
(End of fiction).	1.9921798318162633
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy.	4.811459246988186
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	4.888917679493176
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation?	3.037052977985591
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution.	3.2067197356067867
That is excellent news!	4.088826942272685
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	4.805928907374187
A very important proposal indeed.	3.270556069615416
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	2.04409523449518
The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna.	3.896124594599972
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	4.4833499552616685
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2472483132960324
So what are we to do now?	2.912951255086278
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.	3.216846260511683
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	3.4254242384416207
I am disappointed in the EPP.	5.012469218357296
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting.	5.449692137813604
But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge.	3.509079937083983
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.	4.561038027064921
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	3.2430015350166124
It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again.	4.506098136079798
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.	4.317571901751789
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	3.426439056428978
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.	3.9016639207769974
If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method.	3.675950754275084
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	3.0274735643293185
Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge Díez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa.	3.0088624527498293
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	5.384256160892952
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry.	2.7531798704648924
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	3.9446299585076035
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology.	4.383337885626637
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter.	4.106915838578273
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	4.095311013532282
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention.	4.985713129781152
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	4.174843227348251
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	3.017972965668708
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.	5.586866579021291
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious.	4.890718204583505
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.	4.284504823525955
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.	4.24071292765529
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea.	4.250948557356037
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	4.1329893874001815
The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures.	3.246418050028008
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming ' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission ' s programme.	3.927327203551325
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.	3.6604632187820156
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	4.163392088497757
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."	3.3762185298838556
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are.	3.4483621704694243
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period?	4.190312107257961
It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner.	3.214438297443354
Thank you, Mr Davies.	3.132708271683178
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment.	3.291770716614939
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.	3.255513668512426
Here improvements should be made.	3.0030990620603557
For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account.	3.750882706238277
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	5.3289287896081206
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture ' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests.	4.775978232175417
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.	3.594402977708501
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	4.126525695447182
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.	4.307527806809378
I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market.	3.7446017684020414
So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans.	3.618582564336423
By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere.	3.078755757656612
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.	4.515857249687433
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	3.3815621015908786
I would like to draw people 's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	3.0733099750391837
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	3.2373489876008756
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups.	4.329764005638786
It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March.	3.0008594701350595
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.	3.318756228449459
Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.	3.2707463954709257
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?	4.327381320650137
A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets.	3.0541252646375665
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	4.032022544455069
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions ' , because that is what we see, in fact.	3.069225732897548
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	4.255435903092023
It did not work; poverty became worse than ever.	3.717472234979487
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts.	5.230743050442592
This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame.	5.018922526328696
(FR) The Commission ' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.	3.167098869588063
The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion.	3.783963382214145
I would suggest that there is a solution.	5.556341704004508
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	3.445683701974035
We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.	4.395785352079621
Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises.	2.481677688404194
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union.	3.6409326872706584
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	3.0607655121463293
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	5.40650615275551
It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries.	3.900504842853237
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	2.782935567395223
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market.	4.084062240003047
Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism.	2.494544728487593
Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty.	4.166248578546597
I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.	3.6845802931055722
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.	2.764536878403662
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	4.220330761521394
This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control.	3.7161406931757504
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.	4.104743496435055
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	3.14656015001606
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material.	3.361047061455107
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	3.4964870378576403
But that cannot be helped.	4.518340022141377
They would then determine their own prices.	4.021004989899502
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	2.320962462321842
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard.	5.641074702081202
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency.	4.671153954796919
To this end, I shall confine myself to stressing, out of all the choices available, the importance of three priority decisions which should, in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission ' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months.	4.33267113085103
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	4.012207045119327
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work.	6.773772078021569
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.	4.231179410426443
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment.	3.6158076771778127
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	3.938478169490062
A new government has come into power in Austria, comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities.	3.8135190507830132
At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM.	3.114456424078906
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.	3.850420650962581
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.	4.15210307937898
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	4.6267642750944
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.	5.000633214283633
Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds.	5.105986722342215
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	5.107209237195545
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.	3.2864380008228857
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.	3.7015413693224364
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.	5.1264166067695855
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war.	4.23869174105573
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	4.261929755115894
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	4.690513783762226
Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage.	4.021759039944711
However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you.	3.8490848136067184
Equality has no pillar of its own.	2.28824886726513
The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit.	4.206429656267103
The debate is a deeply political one.	3.704601131874582
My Group has included two reasonable requests.	3.1507818847095486
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results.	5.273328338287644
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.	4.370933817300252
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.	5.27314094040288
In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry.	3.1532228210721827
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.	2.850270822445313
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	4.0125588029318395
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests.	3.9633341599785004
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	3.829721962290581
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.	4.074587091278232
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy.	3.8654506481776676
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown.	3.0298964728086792
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	3.6421624075147006
It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full.	3.4444726055658657
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.	3.3291121541423454
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
Floods in Mozambique	2.2222376476490147
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	4.517456841842271
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries ' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.	3.7219345141432965
Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this.	2.6351584333589018
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked.	2.582642672268002
I would just make one point: we cannot be 100% sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus.	3.6709429235286914
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	2.469789790196602
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner ' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.	3.2782154415657883
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council.	3.824085792967153
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us?	2.9728008102268286
Well, the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face.	2.5817168651145317
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	3.321946379363334
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	3.0982949186988664
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	4.47314776519504
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.	3.9736342274680556
Strasbourg, 17 February" .	1.8555824789707929
One urban district post office after another is being closed down.	3.2046970315829153
We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.	4.830754927950442
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	3.5587457722180273
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	4.061616154700482
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.	3.851408697184734
The German Government ' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.	3.4314322824721346
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this.	4.378368641931763
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	4.082999387250494
I wish you a good evening.	5.0015474647282945
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	3.3182780634705913
Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000.	2.948526243381728
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	3.4828987988271636
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.	4.954513468926172
Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation:	3.5190401669789653
Quotas are one of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change.	4.701714422871904
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.	4.324097908556849
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance ' .	3.6750359431184783
We should, of course, not get overly excited about it.	4.1581504333758135
On behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	3.012319279605911
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers.	3.523042405466591
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	6.854985592046096
The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance.	3.8306192170602773
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel ' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	3.3194063376957827
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	3.3695854028674153
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.	3.5081694505494143
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.	4.120354779582065
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.	3.287054716564116
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality.	3.3804665417908715
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	3.0606143501561935
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.	3.803718771122027
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	4.187925235646942
We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste.	2.9991930849003428
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.	3.92745678593398
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation.	2.773323010482354
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	4.133799471084176
My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda.	4.1751981151032
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament.	3.631907497966858
The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms.	5.964435336633223
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe?	3.145591631946274
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.	5.992572393930691
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.	3.20727765821551
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.	3.8485021923146885
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words.	5.15180373161716
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	3.5270518251656
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	3.7304336487276823
I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001.	4.3130205504210615
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	3.9386594007205242
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	4.351576595665541
This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers.	5.308817253361598
Union Economy (1999)	2.1355482877518046
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	2.8344955222111032
Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention.	2.906516094153563
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.	4.6702544725727835
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	4.433175290317864
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points.	4.055150513827069
We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests.	5.047282046610649
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.	4.272694146178772
I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level.	5.139467570718688
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	3.428837566540308
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.	5.004098549337578
This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution.	5.193260604365984
As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules.	5.204614424678717
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty ' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.	4.253967493905815
I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue.	3.8688155503040718
Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.	4.000765368152584
(The President declared the common position approved (as amended)	2.3992476961620604
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	3.117831202017229
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.	3.112062205562594
The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China.	3.69726421618458
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	4.258544341943752
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	4.117259628107881
That should be our task, not political posturing.	3.7834756568062096
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.	3.7001097815174
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?	3.610656385161581
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	5.141927152544015
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.	2.901712413467521
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union ' s aims.	4.174392398213251
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river.	3.866107271025936
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	1.9851691530262678
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control.	3.4947794291596055
The Commission ' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.	4.1767364103201166
With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC.	4.790610174513899
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view.	3.089988230350395
Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution, in this ever controversial debate, which is the result of a broad consensus, seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes.	4.728357936262852
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	3.3385348501217496
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council ' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body ' .	4.411993149606529
You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture.	3.5106270625755207
(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor ' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.	3.0560541642801926
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.	4.520348197631451
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	4.2661685097912265
It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable.	3.5174757974184083
AIDS treatments that may cost $18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $5 per capita.	2.3613028253390778
But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government.	3.293232416454175
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	3.866135333419898
Of course this is also the basic idea.	4.74987460731993
We must never forget to defend civil society.	3.8642364168199177
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet.	3.822141834464313
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation.	3.5347388365232355
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	3.8355248623507534
Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime.	3.456522972034434
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	3.066802671913375
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	3.3857786418593117
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation.	3.8472861410054224
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies.	3.2468635770043375
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions.	3.1933947052759777
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed '.	3.2189988895682733
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.9189609947003876
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.	3.8639572125719055
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	4.734685472429834
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention.	3.7992647003913054
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	5.01309117438894
In this regard, it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit.	4.2645367042776385
In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.	3.612009736711293
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	3.128208191596593
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	3.687609007213922
Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test.	4.853351607427871
In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk.	3.5061586190488274
Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done.	4.911045134790403
The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this.	4.155768663995094
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract.	2.8635043990284723
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect.	4.582317505205848
I hope you will help us.	4.207721392841286
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	4.2625820888252255
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.	4.6330024052120455
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.	4.712159644915277
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	3.1737642255495464
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.	4.066935050056776
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.	3.741697391331032
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	4.072139041536678
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.	3.1767188958837234
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?	5.694280925538005
We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed.	3.6778978606009507
Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies.	2.4583355009277734
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen.	2.524285307390286
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences.	2.3841336828999324
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.	4.134407361062677
This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.	3.821887283619802
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.	3.877452077084009
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.	3.3002415300891172
The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain.	4.398475663662601
Does not the Council ' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?	4.9316597237271855
Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence.	3.7160758375303082
This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government.	3.3814589802869417
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything.	2.656612797800118
I would also like to stress, as many Members have highlighted, that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe ' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union.	3.792739646697299
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	4.361310256565859
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	3.062092848130886
The delta of the Danube is in danger.	5.956820649242312
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree.	3.4424059340417537
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings.	3.4435810150646566
Will it discuss the matter?	2.767512617940436
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.	4.717277329870415
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify.	4.2595185756044485
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on.	5.165800198850028
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability.	3.803940095487835
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.	5.041119664691297
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	4.3998053796074625
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission ' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	4.531932278800468
You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech.	3.831371906317464
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.	3.7913882850596905
But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year.	2.948109453562054
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.	4.528633164539167
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	4.2788434581741965
The Commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	3.409025334245861
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	3.9182032932451283
The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.	3.814149119391647
We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.	4.640261989048213
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	5.0435870275569625
It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.	4.720640226465884
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty dans la realité.	3.24140703002507
Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.	4.149577885906443
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	4.943480371484009
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order.	4.0564089509292565
As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	3.0729680417441214
Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President.	2.7996800934192856
The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support.	3.6683599782047174
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.	3.6273782686891574
Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward.	3.7998530106629307
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	3.8780359887519866
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	3.217659569281441
Happy Valentine ' s Day!	2.5015167059098604
This is the topic.	4.329298873514718
This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission.	4.234023020540216
We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise.	3.9400983048259737
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another.	5.4031643193507986
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union ' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.	4.137835457735893
We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure.	3.896876467076602
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.	3.894288319244882
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002.	5.189915322352381
In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is a matter which we are currently dealing with.	4.593582230125313
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	3.5017026086688685
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.	4.414860375590371
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.	3.4127477286999186
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	3.8136478544155614
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	4.2627036186816145
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.	4.95529713464676
We need stronger banking supervision.	4.63023685329477
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.	3.0402440494420047
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners.	3.302278946086291
For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area.	3.3573733117834847
At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.	4.180646691063664
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	4.733248521197662
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok ' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	3.677986901809683
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence.	4.496118293044188
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	3.18405090762849
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands.	5.730786366317019
I hope that we can thrash this out.	4.063143554828923
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	3.890318254172037
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers.	4.082881630993146
A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health.	4.202180291060222
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers.	4.298021267851684
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.	3.83353052609528
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	4.309313437113817
At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it.	3.378195359193796
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.	3.3320757403963555
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.	3.665218546754446
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.	1.9744444623690107
I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area.	4.394052388081942
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.	3.3078882350149206
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty.	2.8409028631326474
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force.	2.9858187913571546
It is therefore easy to understand the public ' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them.	4.103561307684038
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate.	3.9027851129194224
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted.	4.581593168581225
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed.	3.995013881937717
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	4.406447083405037
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	4.522216216778869
b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels	2.85327225184094
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework.	4.02702284511948
The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy.	2.9776853627710085
The Commission has no means of influence here.	4.022349675485526
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.	4.10618197823046
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	3.8343532757911474
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.	4.547738684531774
That is a clear complaint that we get.	4.130686114791555
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	3.2526717800953198
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	4.056339864610784
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member.	5.238398228825343
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others.	3.4357839880824024
Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000):	2.0495242688171422
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	3.437811045622674
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	4.181651504257322
The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public.	3.9611231366610844
I urge the Commission to be less cautious.	5.419161579726997
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty, the end of the nation-state, and so on. But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France, including British student, Isabel Peake, who was thrown off a train, shows why we need mutual recognition.	3.5015139151291157
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	3.6640508192153862
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.	3.953376240165915
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?	4.16662692102217
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President.	3.755671526599704
I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster.	3.614944898025925
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	4.196150325330386
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need.	3.7170851712904285
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.	4.535775451433357
Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy.	2.6003326592575493
We believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention, but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation.	4.729207029122942
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	5.998014479128416
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.	4.304761455955289
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	3.352741719862666
If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres.	3.686754424862718
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.	4.215226789412747
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead.	4.085245914150691
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.	2.553992847712247
The Commission ' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives).	2.900102992010927
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect.	3.883479172496037
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	4.64711752924557
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone.	3.8418152183776906
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	4.130125498767315
We need to work.	3.7985051141551356
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post ' s numerous recent acquisitions.	4.128727644553405
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	4.652384460873173
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.	5.318650331119793
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.	3.2949614051227196
Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year, approximately 200 000 died in wars.	2.8787320662422022
I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it.	4.7654274503061975
Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich, so much so that it became difficult to gather, i.e. to put those decisions into practice.	3.215947625402109
In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union.	3.6580714269276924
In response I can only say that this already exists.	4.856948178650343
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries.	4.407953667152589
. (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.	3.526363131620234
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	4.099923208525784
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear.	4.550392363219099
In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.	4.808686286192356
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	3.7821385739654363
Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area.	3.410175728547487
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.	3.527956706558729
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.	3.8930482812007434
Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand.	3.8531034704873517
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again.	4.791653600221165
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies.	4.996309678870103
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives.	3.605514336095421
This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.	5.969165627687204
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	4.169033227795628
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	4.116408209582989
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.	3.893460149065097
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.	3.5347693785814496
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	5.063131350071006
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation.	3.4027853447710745
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	3.38933535812862
Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life ' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment.	4.039300714151892
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	3.633281730907106
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice.	4.314957878015472
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct.	3.4563229146982914
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.	4.075326509197728
It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are.	3.9240180641406215
The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks.	4.660689188917803
Why do I say that culture is important?	4.069361971595083
Perhaps 'redundant ' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	4.6949715211357175
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	4.5613069467377185
As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector.	4.165446450057548
And since this is St. Valentine ' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	4.93996367185489
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously ' called autonomous.	3.311510989091559
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	4.882772828995391
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	4.940962403148357
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.	5.863171611831079
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments.	3.2421290467842883
It is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises.	4.3457274993669825
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.	4.894731568738439
Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power.	2.5898644359236
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	3.590821866553172
This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.	3.3289887787423207
The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	3.876881764446823
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	5.021223091319611
We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union.	2.929295577231828
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union ' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	4.10863431786317
Which is why the new 20-year agreement due to be signed in Fiji on 31 May represents more than the simple renewal of the Conventions regulating relations between Europe and the ACP.	3.598531865391937
That, however, is not my question.	2.7320580957718343
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.	3.8435598080893256
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	2.867631584329098
Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed.	3.686785953182947
Most say it is about time.	4.31516733696614
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	3.8167049541508065
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.	3.926700393411578
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically.	3.846247139053939
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more.	6.044895044508269
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force?	4.054155446562703
Mr Marinos, we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, the cultural dimension is, I am sure you will appreciate, one of our main concerns.	4.599592396124426
For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe.	4.656312747840912
Unfortunately, this is not true of them all, but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report.	5.454782379686555
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.	4.048176575215666
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned.	3.923742855827403
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.	4.480680056801167
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.	2.9565899826433584
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission.	4.640298360108643
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	3.4973720913892046
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected.	4.938714314969346
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	3.760153042103012
This event must underpin enlargement.	4.948545761513312
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.	4.421384970870491
Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	3.3484872178936924
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people ' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	2.886199858350138
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers ' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.	4.643617028804438
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	4.208662308111918
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.	4.051976936722522
I refer to point 9.	4.58424145706421
. (DE) Mr Cohn-Bendit, I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country ' s domestic politics, in the way that you are doing.	4.368276083516031
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	3.931509907216119
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic.	4.186394745159928
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report.	4.2791417092776065
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.	4.335848321327865
Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled.	3.856603058552185
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	4.5529562811203315
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.	3.0065283974514645
We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.	4.300973248363514
It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes.	4.044889444839651
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	3.284202922396532
These possibilities should be fully exploited.	4.994865047139288
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.	3.958941818908965
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.	5.061235278078415
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament ' s backing.	4.224429878351246
But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control.	3.9544879479950192
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology.	4.841933330657495
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote.	3.1920139279527624
It also contains four calls to the Member States which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs, particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments. These would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively, such as the tourist sector.	4.516880067344313
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	4.6406432957414365
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	3.7300407741261696
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.	4.3466074399348
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world ' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher.	3.7215757468171398
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention.	5.293747226136056
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders.	4.905859385150774
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	4.025529459012157
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.	3.0867272595384057
Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.	2.4677111926152344
I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances.	3.7272364716334097
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately.	2.555356796877616
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.	4.62787874635566
If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens.	3.5729896892235598
There are problems regarding the term "author" .	3.6292918381192893
The impression that Africans get, namely that they are inferior world citizens, is not unfounded.	4.689493111345308
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	2.8921407722902424
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi, has quite won me over.	2.637564837241752
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	4.552968973283757
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	3.787189508743703
Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them" , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries" .	4.480640559674284
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	4.636539248764933
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe ' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.	4.356843677341938
I believe that, over time, the Council of the European Union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue.	5.828810505349026
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000.	4.13378832780659
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another.	2.7040271629790804
Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes ' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent.	3.7607007678560107
Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban, Labour ' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same.	2.7660953667856796
Of course it is as you say.	2.833760510069521
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.	3.1154547402380044
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic.	4.583551616677801
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders.	3.846671089403859
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.	3.8126413194737214
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.	5.059773511242019
According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea.	2.8522064249721857
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.	2.2370848615350565
That is unacceptable in a democracy.	3.839908472554338
This trio 's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said.	3.232766807236995
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	4.587661752354056
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity.	4.512918368437715
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	3.3236059926113373
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind.	4.607873948434111
Mr President, Commissioner, before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would like to share with you three basic factors which, in my opinion, determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment.	3.696564791572166
This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People ' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it.	4.205816975941869
The party led by François Mitterrand, decorated with the emblem of Marshal Pétain ' s Vichy government, the party whose leading lights have just been caught red-handed once again, living a life of luxury on the public funds embezzled from the students ' mutual insurance company.	2.912975597087
. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	2.9340402539476695
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day?	3.784091894257921
Most of Parliament ' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious.	3.434956742267164
The world ' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	3.74320961266785
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.	5.891512377371771
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects.	5.3845946234276845
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	4.858395692851707
There is no backbone, and no teeth.	3.202386447433002
They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.	3.825653080829566
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	4.728848246713764
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.5058264775679655
So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation.	4.192579879494438
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	4.136326038602864
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy.	4.036395612571866
In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia ' s U-turn.	3.8079018796764443
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition?	4.504346270432549
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities?	3.814598742497161
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.	4.367031621221877
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.	3.5766933609682496
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens ' representatives.	5.361068493956699
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45.	3.4414475308983157
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups.	3.9389709934880877
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.	3.3724981961366387
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	4.59376733643715
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.	4.116332613311874
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims, alimony claims and non-contested claims.	3.1448912397463493
In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries.	3.762831298032941
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right.	4.911967779708764
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	5.417050120625586
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.2028131983846255
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	3.4280196883373324
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	3.634799411521366
It is high time that we reached an agreement.	3.0169917708862237
Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure.	4.07162122905879
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections?	4.129352937168534
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	5.705431957882125
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0142/2000) by Messrs Mrs Hautala, Mr Lannoye and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the strategic objectives for 2000-2005	2.586674020745943
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production.	5.018957530408337
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control.	4.775954173423561
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.	3.0797221017936605
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.	4.100462449266528
Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process.	5.300169148680639
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.	5.165004578469426
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission ' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	4.595060313346156
It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way.	3.8836906723533766
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	4.7692417760345505
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.	4.045318577883395
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	3.668831604408828
Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.	4.3342896675021585
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment.	4.196279907449507
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	3.8677522530941055
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	4.2433756681602715
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	3.9118777363930506
Reforming the Commission	2.083676367610933
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.	3.3024818662695
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	4.893103938739979
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	4.6365715151949844
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	3.47281802986176
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998.	5.736297334337046
I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge.	5.899179341733724
Read Mr Katiforis ' s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment.	2.7992970566664606
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House.	5.245004022716059
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes.	4.145446964599592
But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	4.218267383325321
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world.	3.9188336298774895
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.	3.416655612805372
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	4.5702296239149796
In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.	3.0853811035477916
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.	4.6932102835721
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	4.093434511594319
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.	3.561459165947355
Thank you, Mr President.	2.5909026037683853
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.	4.629923908340072
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.	2.6946746928690755
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance.	4.480067239923533
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.	4.704765408745569
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.	3.374712480818562
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector.	4.461605520599515
But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers.	3.229379929058316
Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999.	4.8653458454650425
Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.	4.048224904181444
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	3.7244052739312368
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.	4.581838728508723
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political, and has no basis or technical viability.	3.3339027953783216
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect.	3.15417254767102
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	3.196333485670208
This is very much on their minds.	3.9378094168435833
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example.	5.081610006390461
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.	4.610703959343451
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	3.263796778155294
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	3.34491400312267
This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening.	5.014370708500852
In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	4.371073660517341
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.	4.544654768326102
(Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes)	2.8614166426410246
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome.	3.9771594467834146
I emphatically support the rapporteur ' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.	5.58835949723794
I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine ' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	4.63422153788912
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	4.083998490690992
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.	2.738130219451639
They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.	3.9715168405632753
I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.	4.1914183134337515
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.	3.659079703977663
The labour market is also changing.	4.509193630319339
I have decided, in the end, that the most remote regions, to which I attach particular importance, will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG, with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions.	4.174243213567357
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union.	4.12297330691202
Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	2.5818493082158045
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	3.8242075867435816
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	3.132654922745009
The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries.	3.347959876730297
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	3.171700362656011
The Commission ' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.	4.727305228318293
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.	5.220949920261838
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions.	3.9035814349928497
It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring.	4.0295085814281215
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	4.28631263478672
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.	5.775291374604436
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	4.724285357770645
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.	3.6253705753155496
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.	3.6313915479056598
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	4.097359195670642
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	1.6621124568602526
The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States.	3.2566207299789225
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	3.083840013844853
It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister.	3.416954436892428
We have also asked Parliament ' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries.	5.0089012407831675
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	3.431613886716662
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.	2.9483215708052954
The next item is the report (A5­0030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission: 'Enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment ' [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)].	2.5191437717841527
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	3.4205790678036894
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	4.371199376509502
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.	5.334253270862727
I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs.	2.367452190360924
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission ' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	4.348392877450725
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	3.3492183620806304
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	2.8801154239266458
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	3.6962935728072757
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause.	4.459122522119648
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.	3.638769024938262
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	4.462564912298926
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.	3.887477604218517
Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime.	3.034549235442811
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	3.825284691677974
We think there are other positive advances too.	5.144692284807647
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	4.786227673595931
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	3.507380957832981
It is, above all, the manufacturer ' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car ' s life-cycle.	4.1726766209437045
For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia.	4.773498741466879
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)	1.9451468837011094
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.	4.374827523690136
We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies. We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU ' s external action.	4.276562093393988
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	3.918008909140606
However, housing is specifically excluded.	4.474467047575875
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	4.554732721294346
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.6488263573675483
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	4.491856974100948
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States.	3.8693696571348495
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.	3.3778195191396816
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.	4.486706577823632
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.	3.948664889898387
In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity.	5.301884572881834
How do you think a system like that would affect people ' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	3.075877365498566
By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors.	3.2675318334866192
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	3.8211870397821017
Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh.	3.9553371282941243
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society ' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.	3.2926515643644496
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted.	3.8908558131971422
However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.	3.4262591419602413
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector.	3.59447133408555
In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons.	4.6059314879906825
We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.9257679171887294
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.	3.878562460586604
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age.	3.182979298782253
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.5105815722368825
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI.	3.7322035349741167
Turning to judicial cooperation, in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings.	3.88190727130662
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	3.8319602085389297
However, nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it.	4.310824369132079
There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups.	3.40518917436404
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect.	2.528596961119905
Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle.	3.8168966805575324
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	4.2906402234527246
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.	5.166445088042195
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	3.4512967046487
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	3.2901164578418824
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served	4.537107772157929
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.	4.777575680126877
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.	4.26958788247246
For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use.	5.3230204974514335
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively.	5.815017495472385
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.	3.3952704879280167
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine 's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	3.318712379582042
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.	4.482670792885812
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	4.443446678029351
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?	4.305843729649511
Proposal for a joint resolution on coherence of different Union policies	2.3656800772734528
The postal service is also the doctor.	4.626654180227264
Second Part	2.4595397693537033
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.	3.8654728734702424
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union ' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment.	3.45474042157574
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission ' s original budget.	3.5177650355187446
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.	5.117045331691271
I believe that this issue is relevant to my question. Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening ' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections.	3.4629441577003472
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.	3.275642172163882
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it.	4.647290660135319
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	3.1839697839356482
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	3.540309527117079
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	3.9583841051123048
The Commission did not do that.	4.775502668458787
(FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency.	3.8430180460395493
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.	3.4808945025502944
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU 's food safety regime in the years ahead.	4.7461911882016725
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them.	5.623296088972167
This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations.	3.4592327045699047
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism, so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age.	4.390960276046202
You did not call me either.	3.0207852339794314
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.	3.481674554969909
In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text.	3.5907202419185924
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.	3.9940770174691567
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	3.7675100111881576
Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer.	4.439806822378434
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica.	3.3259986274036626
It also creates protection for software and databases.	4.062290200843416
Mr President, you said during last week ' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	3.805320135058591
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.	2.7381814250969416
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	3.3880126628072462
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	4.756946600713949
We have 1.27% of the Community ' s GDP.	4.521493278365352
We are all entitled to clean drinking water.	3.738598355920562
I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum.	5.041415620064106
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	3.173093731767974
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.	3.756288091157718
We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety.	4.007345163011574
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product.	3.509187316257468
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission ' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	4.542426671102718
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	4.36562621160311
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.	3.8272862625159276
The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.	3.863512016173271
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	4.623233886492587
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament ' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	4.923031763652105
I feel that today ' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider ' s party.	4.22184918742941
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.	4.205514302894229
It is, however, interested in official statements and actions.	3.523376110473335
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.	6.156358211619645
Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community ' s environmental policy.	4.856355915490192
It is good that the procedure exists.	3.66182377832937
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious ' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	3.3904908090039934
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.	3.8157322374864666
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company ' s decision.	3.788488566768313
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy ' s effectiveness which must therefore, in my opinion, be significantly improved.	4.182405330490902
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government ' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria ' s governing conservative party and its policy.	3.430537690693171
At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly.	4.388992361199774
This is a political question which, in the short term, requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament.	4.164015236419099
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union ' s cultural policy activities once again.	4.261972480583824
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.	4.323909030274402
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.	3.8597255729185824
As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected.	3.341506886222527
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.	4.022277876917194
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	3.7001246504701806
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.	3.7034580125880616
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me.	4.7501397581824
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.	5.170970471381554
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency ' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	3.6037022748890317
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	2.1834730071208996
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	2.3856077537540856
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector.	4.0709005345560625
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries.	4.481277671426533
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424.	5.009980521300761
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	5.2132215828397355
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union ' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	4.262221456291927
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner.	4.667929616549057
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	4.060536166736887
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road.	3.568281189558848
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.	4.217957292828606
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.	4.581301949489426
Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets.	3.5311275355456626
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	5.537185247643609
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	3.8431341608496314
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees.	3.374794052006903
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	4.717974717058936
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming, mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs.	4.337968463073984
It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market.	3.7122054240602465
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated.	4.759596449254119
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States ' government deficits.	4.588922292607964
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.	4.5306487398724755
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	5.862717395922794
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.	3.3364047085911928
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work.	4.708393485159116
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	3.7079172696272833
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.	3.0548342169624303
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union.	4.18144235129947
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	4.421840976995041
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked.	3.638227363967897
I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect.	5.722884387887006
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	3.458055673250532
This war must be stopped.	4.974032378429621
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.	3.814052502090265
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.	3.328557715631396
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.	3.884550775502871
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings.	2.937842623187737
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	5.451596649804616
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark.	4.554521322258548
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.	3.173926961455486
And it is still on the agenda today.	4.355556637727358
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS).	1.8599509374229872
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	3.6033160924406773
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	3.562954449678868
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.	4.439956918329931
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	3.931054338334545
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not.	3.959242912919395
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo	2.8583540492959596
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.	3.8746325249169478
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work.	3.009945243905487
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	3.882542188265818
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	3.578773356149987
Both of them have done a first-class job.	4.215084930206674
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour.	3.6713726098377304
I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement.	3.8263811541822896
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament ' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	4.131671559103176
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	3.585944556419879
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	3.134493165786348
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.	2.778415026611792
But they might accidentally do great damage.	3.815660705790171
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	4.014461790165369
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations.	4.971513668869055
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention.	4.604262026692464
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme ' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	4.31248919067801
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court.	3.556814967523538
These amendments can all be approved.	3.7669934874681763
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	4.025226293989722
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.	2.2892961043708033
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.	3.883515460176837
Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.	4.299461417377102
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG?	3.5411636702796603
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.	2.987124131786566
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	4.87596289849159
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all.	4.458986880682271
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	3.4750869137942937
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	4.148521681446236
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union ' s institutions.	4.486953922004568
We already have a directive.	5.022726476715005
Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily.	3.0424613121409254
We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area.	4.0451207632415205
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.	5.071587060754761
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.	4.143934873707321
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio ' s action plan with open arms.	4.041344893752217
The next item is the joint debate on:	2.1404424566687466
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	4.488723541855225
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.	3.8267619820052423
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.	6.345194689091109
This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more.	3.0674569676869257
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	2.5939061271405786
Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist.	3.375515271467313
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	5.019821422494042
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.	5.726444454868116
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	3.1423873215739584
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	4.9542338346729835
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	3.4847321028164155
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.	3.475738657150659
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent.	3.5219038574675627
We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported.	5.172939060071266
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia	3.5768612876899346
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report?	4.803993054763914
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.	3.6745888558483326
That is absolutely absurd.	4.872662389983651
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	3.5229683085020245
I wonder how this will develop.	5.156550329923119
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	4.264421224177997
I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line.	4.029142241146984
But we must look always to subsidiarity.	4.2711724605527595
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	3.3003953517428952
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.	4.072182359801708
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.	3.313137181768409
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion.	2.11884837137375
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.	4.2656898696004175
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.	4.757631597548426
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage.	4.051644527837602
I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly.	5.26642600812083
And when that day comes, it is too late.	2.7006536604364753
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are.	3.312380621222631
A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	4.4613820570696845
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself.	3.5035785303542677
We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere.	4.833730185919536
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.	4.909089588274608
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.	4.143783541159342
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers ' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	3.6333421766792053
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there.	5.254923828273581
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	3.5228894169815814
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right.	3.3513293330555047
Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible.	4.639985852442112
In terms of balance, or should I say imbalance, I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict.	4.259657752572171

I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.	3.2503278774470203
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	4.470988208579183
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain.	3.6576911271849006
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	4.484370917321239

Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	3.1686228798984426
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.	4.044500218171848
'Restore hope ' , do you remember?	2.33939512806686
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	4.453148748138627
Even in this Chamber, the Council ' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories.	5.173518815644751
Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.	3.3720334834779324
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.	4.479269087232632
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	4.37652053202556
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	3.996586672151901
In this respect we must not forget that the original victim ' s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated.	3.227401453704416
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	5.104268394399726
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women?	4.666728626758948
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.	2.267944362730792
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement.	4.042834637846617
When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish.	3.9087759325204914
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	6.105098737951267
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks?	2.8981695601843245
(Parliament approved the joint text)	1.5688564067660473
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	4.317837609419501
I hope that it works out.	4.62568889777534
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable.	4.863499379162435
We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment.	3.3942146296135767
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	3.787087798054011

I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	3.84004118119375

Mr President, during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was pleasantly surprised.	3.21644987804574
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	3.591598853081661
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.	2.785357362774658
That service will open on 1 May this year.	3.7388327580870127
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	4.79276895231693
Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.	4.351741139567799
I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism.	4.550665111548962
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.	3.7217142201504894
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.	4.43061761983732
For safety ' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman ' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	5.387620694114784
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	4.379827885805999
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	3.8586978116059236
. (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sjöstedt, for this question.	2.967340209165218
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens ' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	4.73413110225722
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	3.5646632793009876

Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.5033529389158162

I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	4.257033840827787
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	3.657556860418195
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	5.275333727892225
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	4.379778505697861
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	3.8038871369488145
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.	3.301306675765709
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	4.852974198873354
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	2.963835842129122
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	1.852088389290747
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue.	3.4415197352793405
We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand.	3.8408351565146948
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective.	3.7303061635304977
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999.	3.377699050296797
In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.	3.8206908468992506
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors.	4.127359158357725
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.	4.204291618332832
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.	4.339889694452022
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.	3.9426569705083834
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them.	3.6171068828654716

Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)	1.9227001443555967
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.	4.748167869540193
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	4.425307209227705
There is as yet no federal European tax.	3.482447136651927
Finally, I welcome the Commission 's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	5.0327872695212115
Mr President, "The EU ' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired" .	4.282347391677279
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.	3.9954417884012785
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria ' s integrity.	4.48308922799551
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.	4.759647099589611
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.	4.084251881077343
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.	3.5676363761803165

But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal.	3.386935456246993
With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission.	4.203592094538545
The company ' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying.	4.538993546364195
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.	3.3816518389741197
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	4.668383035047261
The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised.	5.214183457766571
In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets.	3.7619253415951914
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.	5.589079999619748
At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.	2.820675234309831
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work.	3.758824452961505
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.	3.5468400730392506
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.	3.6992455395104975
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	4.063390022142808
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe.	4.456634674301018
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.	3.8630055232995018
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	3.940309074997605
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.	4.153550972336193
In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant.	3.6472178880692283
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?	3.755559431558377
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.	3.6291318463770192
We must meet these challenges together.	4.7665743189377645
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.	3.959228041339549
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished.	3.620157359767815
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.	3.776500893229683
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect.	4.707317650890936
In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" .	3.849655338117322
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for their constructive approach.	2.838185273932338
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency ' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	4.198885153325284
Mr President, the European Union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.	3.7411422383774147
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	3.7225689757276226
Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration.	3.410916458412238
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.	3.8430088892977206
I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions.	5.239372262332872
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	2.2246876772156776
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy.	3.131222040804351
This brings home the connections which bind us together.	3.70626978154078
EQUAL stands for "equality" .	2.587054677188465
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	4.141300712561224
The European Union ' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.	4.742936831217
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners ' Party.	3.584215061801159
Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee.	3.821330231566426
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping.	4.848811501102891
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	3.3096890563033563
That is what this framework decision is about.	3.5886267871203508
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally ' s report, namely women ' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.	3.5887639202371875
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	4.500827655135879
He has done really good work in a very short time.	3.794672167030497
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	4.84988453560256
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.	4.094033878378937
One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance.	4.495538957985886
By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon.	3.6927272371302786
With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept.	3.8374811104270807
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.	4.028532617999399
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	3.2089843842523935
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it.	4.421946714307014
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability.	3.586487111940334
Report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)0344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)	2.2948115434045877
First, streamlining.	4.171143130619476
This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.	5.649525708474411
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented.	6.1438920372189845
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	3.2015588725945445
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	4.460959209860168
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	4.379762057610637
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.	4.075177840638963
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	4.902644700722145
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	4.428882416329948
Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market.	3.883454137675123
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	3.755568608410951
As for the peace process in Cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations, I would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two.	3.617264926530932
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	4.0582554325262254
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	4.105455132539936
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	3.6346991817385472
Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.	3.6620787768790364
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic: the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies.	3.915166157600046
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling.	4.611855711869884
I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.	4.324852752742626
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	4.2345340204259685
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	4.120853563009217
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	3.117747834122341
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights.	4.574242526862266
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.	3.5641520231401613
. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.	4.925635036872565
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.	3.481327082463018
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.	2.6001044594543115
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval.	4.604139850856081
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.	3.0004309024931595
This latter point is of particular importance.	3.6946699862555787
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon.	4.1826268310700545
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed.	3.7416570696990976
Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno ' .	2.328538650343155
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	4.302067006133971
In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland" [ "Reminiscing about Holland" ], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected.	2.6314582285995227
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion.	4.623666086418514
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	3.800097049237005
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	3.8935019569134757
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.	3.7957787672284535
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	4.743046985142207
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	4.384067347267568
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson.	4.183725248800385
We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties.	4.303420184312589
Mrs Lucas should do the same.	2.7941973361036037
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.	3.851107477419607
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.	3.779700140416337
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.	4.427492302126662
As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today.	3.7740599267204296
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.	3.4609931942888075
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	4.251210574859141
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?	4.4070037915721985
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo Núñez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	3.3359368394837445
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	4.219988051315742
Obviously, he said "the federal solution would be best" .	2.1971644861221344
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.	5.595632428114524
Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.	2.8525099846387687
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.8005890760472703
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	4.32097125389198
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	3.644227534031018
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.	3.370225042396999
Most companies hate competition.	3.0975923941095442
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.	4.554293693174825
That is why he deserves special mention!	3.4239001958409396
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust.	4.7118542504319
Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.484591952674166
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve.	4.9819205324997435
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	3.5942512423061244
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.	4.918724573949291
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed.	7.402241611999766
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women ' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	3.9807381717942394
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	3.5476594802298074
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	3.353405391781282
As things are at present, the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel 's water supply.	3.48315229657265
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	4.669525029242466
It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on.	3.2892049849510543
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process.	4.611354194172426
If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed.	5.090207606453694
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency.	4.031483157921549
But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action.	3.2245334520790863
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration.	3.977302509293136
For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one.	3.6058741321968064
Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission.	3.746856625637096
Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered.	3.606713057938283
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	3.25622550470769
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	4.589625120899885
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector.	6.164400556771019
One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully.	4.20280729612693
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	3.021521877637609
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.	5.876768169154045
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	4.991119917569415
We have a new Commission.	4.151478623880964
The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority.	4.699989598261934
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	4.933125066675541
In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.	4.570839304357517
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	5.08075434658297
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	3.9056158302762096
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition.	4.035144018223846
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	3.4363748080720513
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector.	5.014425863142586
The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and "national interests" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions.	3.9883439363116207
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.	3.188222852150537
In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass.	3.7314441981915314
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.	4.298434230101602
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	3.802252819860057
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency ' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	3.5416234397304756
That is positive.	3.511089706947246
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	4.227072133362058
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.	4.032435699591216
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe ' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.	3.4926908583050977
By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector.	3.2349496131519424
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.	4.562453964344165
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises.	5.1395650161246005
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated, so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities: they are drawn by the bright lights, and the pubs, and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied.	3.1115803333649565
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	4.135888525023196
Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms.	3.1165712605042426
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	5.064413124005385
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	3.7874343653199274
Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus.	3.8965410959894835
Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	4.277212209646034
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.	2.8407666783842096
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
But we have to grasp the tools to do that.	4.148234437177769
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women ' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.	3.9058117062595312
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.	3.5856616504267937
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance.	3.4917070171538716
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	3.7487985677721793
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	2.175195782718469
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.	5.061687274185862
To give you an example, in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions, the equivalents of the English words: "in so far as" have been omitted.	3.3924645001544116
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities.	2.9830865169671057
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe, and for the area of freedom, security and justice in particular.	3.8761403100536143
That cannot continue.	4.82843947789438
What can the Commission do about that?	3.3563189243016356
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report.	3.5349201648082733
I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy ' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).	3.940384379344975
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.	3.9977116465342606
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.	3.889978819421351
If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned.	3.992095820920932
That concludes Question Time.	2.387574992743204
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?	3.5059590130616747
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	3.9871375594185134
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	3.8625475934424376
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	4.998257633625759
In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law.	3.3394066869958685
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.	3.498357901329915
If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression.	3.534261296593489
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	3.7560818345949802
Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.	5.623929452336772
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see.	5.242076507774302
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	3.3887770941422315
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.	4.237015632121899
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	4.286154505238511
As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.	4.125460630880507
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	4.028549338759218
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe.	3.4287330366548314
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union ' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives.	3.9303821794438836
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist.	3.350700192757596
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	4.415420273482245
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.	3.020222830268034
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	4.016398967566372
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	3.2926854054548764
Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe.	3.578046251705667
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	4.637594681782617
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.	2.4841832721615273
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	2.5191952502219266
Firstly, the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed.	3.695454168493993
Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.	5.4602985782700255
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.	5.175740646891294
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	2.8750098772012755
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.	4.575805366012677
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten ' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	3.4931359273096496
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.	5.691882431355781
We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley.	4.388802152486133
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.	3.157470709766805
Please rise, then, for this minute ' s silence.	3.1939188047500826
Then, by gearing actions to micro-projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and, finally, by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba, which all the ACP called for at Nassau and which has now made a formal application.	3.666706029246389
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.	4.688540815990563
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	3.9554106159653135
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	5.159605278603056
In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.	3.584488079327355
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment.	4.160019435618342
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	3.8684827148388017
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	3.873813830708701
NATO is largely European.	2.156435679035745
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	3.4232784848799453
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.	5.034072389210197
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	3.5251357150979183
I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other.	3.0856645883201503
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000 ' the programme of the citizen.	4.818155948195612
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing ' .	2.8958502520099745
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution.	4.639068957525705
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	3.2284649760186164
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive.	3.537907025321181
What are the Council 's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	1.760753097678976
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister ' s treasury funds.	4.081104928790365
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.	6.151257939836417
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other ' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies.	4.503432004776207
It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission ' s best asset, its richest resource.	4.083093526312941
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.	4.773568282446235
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.	6.556352342710476
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	4.284541477641105
We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.	3.5986160114334944
I just wanted to correct this.	3.1595202493255683
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	3.4549803205509297
Mr President, Mr Andersson ' s report contains a lot that is of interest.	4.437658151454263
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome.	5.243835256241327
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	3.760889033738411
In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers ' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions.	3.115666809352166
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment.	4.433452559202034
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	4.807965768856536
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	4.377654686939469
I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars.	5.001025970292669
It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor.	3.2010249731754374
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	4.906318149330502
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission ' s legislative programme.	3.9495198692755062
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.	5.220290002868585
Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):	2.647824139682015
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure.	3.5060680616307933
As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament.	4.827054996962558
As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity.	4.416975181330731
I believe that this is actually a good thing.	4.2234148949116515
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.	5.1911672468476375
Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament.	3.3542039817063043
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	3.762927589432886
- (EL) The Freedom Party ' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union ' s political future.	4.5818727465494815
However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project.	4.708297466099312
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday.	4.3632882010932885
What is now needed is action.	3.7218236884192293
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen.	4.88396333047963
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.	3.4905273388856686
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	3.8068975646067096
That foundation is clearly the single market.	3.8801183120224785
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.	7.51673131190819
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	3.014328381927575
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years.	3.7840976785186555
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place.	3.778183080733735
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	4.381262599460019
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	3.3192354724100714
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts".	4.13008208054693
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	3.051731458174508
Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia.	4.435972473747021
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	3.980101568510581
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together.	2.8844778828562734
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	4.542352621449182
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries.	3.434102574328187
The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern.	4.8193277997748964
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.784114817865386
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.	4.897866141054068
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum.	2.0403336598665582
Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote.	3.820832713162265
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	2.790381091428491
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation.	4.434943864831908
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission ' s proposal on scrapie.	4.457088386061112
Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention.	3.287048094410765
Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint.	2.7173137857815592
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio, and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection.	4.206039414436672
The same applies to European air traffic control.	3.5562971559615266
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	4.045008213692557
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.	5.097853412201206
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	3.7812305421035037
In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another.	4.62464543898671
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	4.667371574057548
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	2.852548663139991
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries ' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU.	2.71273581336083
We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours.	5.337706600717454
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.	4.048117802516636
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so.	3.3383247760025045
This applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect.	4.751058136472102
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.	4.99569452300395
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	4.566432801171261
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	3.4640549092159287
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	3.986468870621184
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	3.463057221104034
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	4.04340826138209
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	4.322295515256565
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	6.004744858366718
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat?	3.813453134766645
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	2.8051358893117917
Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon.	3.8738793651614
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee.	3.6212451064410898
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.	3.15004453655537
On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging.	4.233525069158709
I will keep myself free in this connection.	3.705640906715722
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission ' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.	4.53103794525777
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.	4.575040802723757
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.	4.578231282214919
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	3.9627723314707075
The foregoing is the reason for our vote.	5.690746342770124
This is Angola ' s reality.	4.0924630407418965
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union.	3.1380433459837067
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up.	5.030508949531341
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% .	4.285583781322567
Lastly, I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area, as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground.	3.938457496247444
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	4.850527846702444
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	5.320973303161091
We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe.	3.49143060366101
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror.	3.04091501542593
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.	4.3975497158787595
We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission ' s initiative.	4.40958006473493
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	4.9350009952525316
Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems.	3.492063363322839
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two.	3.301851768526862
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.	4.852566939505968
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	3.9985528628160245
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers ' money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers?	3.938241280997322
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	3.1371127422051885
But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security, freedom and justice.	2.7206512225039936
It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.	3.5263466217543766
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue.	3.9692611344102833
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.	2.9912349444485113
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	2.847080818398958
We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law.	3.6955748851112373
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.	3.2309419690433288
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	4.577602154490452
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	4.708246885019888
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union ' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?	5.27902037524106
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted.	3.95761511633989
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	2.8957168260658466
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent.	3.450055669126638
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	4.9528342235920695
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom.	4.576003227802927
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme.	3.580931004986493
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	3.4073549821776505
However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime.	3.246029707799951
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.	4.348364180173053
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.	4.295757713061703
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.	4.549260745002471
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	3.1747021695219373
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.	3.939168605232597
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today ' s debate.	4.207854147364869
Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement.	4.003389275249768
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then.	4.236305749059015
I ask for the Member 's understanding for this small delay in the Commission 's decision.	5.7864590055377585
I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos ' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.	3.159926126764499
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.	4.782390277498078
Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.	2.9528515185811584
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time.	3.728989844836872
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	7.38055713495235
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	3.7728490828260846
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	4.432782708778972
As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind.	3.791861621717772
Report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission recommendation on a Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 - 1999/2121(COS)	2.7270795088751525
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case.	3.6203131754869404
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem, which is fair conditions, fair pay and fair hours.	4.214559502354919
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action.	4.319735239306139
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.	2.46021650937599
As a political force, we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values.	4.070555877053297
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines.	3.9666683429515475
In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague.	3.8789137911965876
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	6.023169280750106
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said.	4.716434778361339
It is far too prescriptive.	5.473994464487459
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	3.048144456056483
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area.	3.7408446897170986
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	3.3951345043811494
Must there be an IGC?	2.3490648895367645
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	3.5967609884440703
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	4.052559079296419
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	3.8406083440696666
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.	4.147444975557309
Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato 's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia 's sovereignty at Rambouillet.	3.508590883998616
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	3.850164608031446
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation ' .	2.8040230607811947
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	4.127746490452741
Thank you for your attention.	2.6596023759795795
It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU.	3.905095929432758
Parliament has taken due note of your comments.	3.782492598935296
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	3.2067391744729474
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	4.218080675579531
We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.	3.303998424603957
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.	4.408154991833974
In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states.	4.689302965373117
We cannot afford to waste time.	3.8051692513738686
I wish to discuss two matters.	4.4930423777995765
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.	4.492851225160099
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	5.268593605984824
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	4.079771604626127
Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock ' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated.	3.3460473162796767
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	4.422787165980145
On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion.	3.5221492002109462
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	3.476865326238162
Brok report (A5-0029/2000)	2.225067792658085
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.	3.8160922089479157
Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal.	3.8529835711037976
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):	2.4827124718907734
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.	4.494291272488804
Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it.	4.646679137943316
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	4.20550207155684
If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	3.4798229810979526
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.	4.562060516233319
We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects. The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted.	3.879002854399821
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.	3.8601715271630535
I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal.	5.500801620369321
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	3.5671184435443584
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.	4.2435130480937895
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.	4.895372014634112
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	4.519047897861105
A fault confessed is half redressed.	4.020877012328642
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	4.268520742048197
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	3.2624633836455317
This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development.	3.6267190117431602
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	4.309471998247115
My question, which has not been answered, is why, when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether.	4.282885705265274
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.	4.31650719348252
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law.	3.4040430077542854
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment.	3.273504694765128
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses.	3.7737458103462402
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	2.1874806033374985
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	3.986054189897562
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.	5.844399957663995
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process.	3.23846322135901
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.	3.1172132137319117
However, since state aid forms the lion ' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer ' s report, to say one more thing about it.	3.410295459666133
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)].	2.507562226872803
Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.	5.257494067255434
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.	4.389631523167069
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context.	4.008974225347152
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.	4.706070737189077
Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000)	2.191925402961653
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.	4.067240733791108
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood.	2.961026259938427
It is essential to establish a single European system, but one based on fairness, full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions, including an end to routine detention.	4.249618058258803
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding.	3.545670963235112
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	2.9304525769190657
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	3.7541512355475373
In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.	3.8281818516769546
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	4.632039536910818
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.	4.283013513066107
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.	4.9544623220370045
The Commission appreciates Parliament ' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role.	4.979286068008935
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	4.128211329426957
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	3.410135675476889
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today.	4.470815252059111
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.	3.0535058308634033
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	4.125071723888611
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.	3.959027611306447
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.	4.070641751226292
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.	4.6922023632737435
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community.	3.7953578149910197
Forgive me Mr Poos.	2.0312903801648563
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.	4.980063991609904
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real.	4.943727063859523
In my grandparents ' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville.	3.6989215848550536
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.	2.2302813863670923
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.	3.891580741850749
We are all concerned about the environment and our children ' s future.	4.737732300602418
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	6.62433123012051
The Commission ' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us, but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna.	4.540989990890847
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	3.477580534660551
This is a major task.	4.70835691753851
It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development.	3.757573179812071
I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays ' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions.	4.003499208724777
The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy ' s objectives and aspirations.	3.3854651183277213
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public.	4.134207443839108
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.	4.082235634469102
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	4.2883834208081675
We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable.	3.520285686473332
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars.	4.922581280194136
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.	4.553149343598359
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?	3.7084395713734426
In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.	3.473238747235172
Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries.	3.7241454272398196
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	3.226610792798757
.	1.3940351656188106
We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives.	2.4757817101598487
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission ' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components.	3.1001804921431586
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	4.713216220568546
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	2.1232312765006887
The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources.	5.320911499888316
Such a concern is misplaced.	3.2093935094934056
In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency.	3.9972857347135227
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	4.076457384445258
As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty.	4.13361030781084
The subject in question is of great political and social importance.	6.74472995874736
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	4.652370439905616
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.	4.305729560959972
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	6.250012832328118
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	4.117880135935017
I support Mrs Lienemann ' s firm stance.	4.722591807638438
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	4.055810171149819
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	4.5142901915378255
However, it is not under threat from Europe.	4.797470788875069
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter.	5.767121267535897
The opinion of Mr Sánchez García, addressed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, contained a remark regarding the IGC.	3.9867098734243145
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .	2.9196429716139822
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus.	4.214523591366509
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	4.942342811228636
Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate.	2.6221352133419344
The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion.	5.055634928043571
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	2.2562220191725046
In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property.	4.024811786013458
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.	3.9873208835391485
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	2.8898716198724888
(Loud, sustained applause from the centre and from the right, protests from the left)	2.873019568828402
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	3.54277781706522
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee ' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	3.7370341248356516
It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a duplicitous package, involves increased repression and control.	3.7512492957344357
As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so.	3.45966610695628
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	4.711557133173832
But where will you place the emphasis?	4.377365137990205
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.	3.7707576596905965
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	4.460359289797219
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group ' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	4.115120028161681
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not.	4.33805909633805
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented.	3.1849352566648954
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	4.326113957680825
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union.	3.430009245017011
Mr President, this proposal aims to incorporate into Community law an ICCAT recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from June 1999, but which only reached this House at the end of last year.	3.2649580660424706
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue.	3.3254655052331854
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)	3.408074510965129
I hope we can have further debates like this.	3.883785436585236
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.	4.317727810218745
In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law.	5.179165816713989
Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these.	3.0635502180587952
However, I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created.	3.8223614723787622
I should like to have an answer to that question.	3.8121856691150504
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos ' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.	4.584205400480494
If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure.	4.3818512300158625
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	5.229446942006398
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.	3.618060458678072
The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role.	4.230335476855269
Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward.	3.5684492380668025
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	3.653180068478378
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	3.9123728351069853
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.	4.664247535583375
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.	6.380050258558494
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	3.6195751471590087
We thank you for that.	6.48095682680348
However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.	4.174387222552093
Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity.	3.4539289864445535
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	3.5110078755928007
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with all these major political challenges, but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway, we are also faced with major opportunities.	3.9821683393524188
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services.	4.433332012179747
But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out.	2.9377654423863055
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	4.970142014727
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.	4.144759673630933
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk.	3.59209028954744
This is largely due to historical factors.	3.789394373716922
In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy.	3.8077916599372403
I say: shame on them!	5.810920863496161
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission ' s attention to this issue.	3.3107520247770488
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	2.98528553759833
In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death.	4.393658565878336
Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter.	3.2156493912553423
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten.	5.21328137623428
This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not.	4.4748288930367135
If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result.	2.9570870602130386
Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points.	3.981643990980009
We, however, second the Council ' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	3.798337785518554
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	5.488586301119242
Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States.	3.770909521631945
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.	3.9454130179449822
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.	3.3756173367086753
Secondly, apart from the shipowners ' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	4.10748606397095
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	4.287873139201152
Secondly, to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds, in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism.	4.035220336665734
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year.	4.362837915654159
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	2.7192076441652535
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	2.865824139076308
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	4.197017086204587
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	3.331350393389544
But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough.	3.929567605914951
We need to wait and see what happens there.	4.530493739313075
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	4.801524479092956
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test?	3.605818267268988
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.	3.5679981646373613
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	4.148724156687246
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters ' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground.	3.744502201324109
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	3.4400165103967626
Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today ' s agenda. We decided on Monday that the Council ' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed.	3.9450988088516263
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.507791013305685
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People ' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable.	2.8662903806503413
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	4.840255697045769
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	4.89575082079361
This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed.	4.0318423870707285
Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny.	3.2346499595227702
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	4.1340610979869155
The EU ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.	5.406829800357268
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	4.5757694750215085
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	5.251029351607108
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.	3.496257162141771
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	4.449079086786274
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	3.4209389884013874
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.	5.386377061778619
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position.	3.199030220063319
I agree with this request.	5.82079426361095
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.	3.925599082392766
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	3.065119389909989
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People ' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People ' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí ' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice.	3.448368892362969
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.	5.288458921493179
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations.	3.086187432961538
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive ' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment.	3.5871441205798096
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.	4.972580170331722
Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned ' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State ' should be added after 'Where ' .	2.960759315407835
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	2.9650734957801244
In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.	3.1231210139956813
As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision.	4.709179376228401
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.	3.2830497173711333
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.	3.5376700796329636
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	3.366854311731785
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament 's next part-session.	3.7691789997581884
Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper.	3.6994731818921034
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	3.499500281011641
If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent, because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns.	4.6880029506218515
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	2.810888663781352
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services.	4.1056508265344895
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.	3.7827289607218484
Mr President, I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM, our national airline company.	4.003029244059888
When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.	3.9704910314013153
We cannot leave it simply to governments.	4.583557034611042
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	4.773317062695466
You can be what you want to be.	3.8316351783128177
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	3.2118351322617733
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	4.387202952565978
The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed.	4.246112097763704
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries.	3.402519686673364
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action.	3.7389158630308574
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	3.108422081768238
Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model ' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone.	3.834408488440109
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	3.1205207227189047
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	3.8576621169658707
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by.	3.6994357655759473
The number of departments has been reduced.	4.168138371293903
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.	2.7843029810677127
Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude.	3.0310499501681347
The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued, non tourist areas, which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments.	3.5503466459418185
I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities, the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports.	4.027032140278129
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	4.732386861881756
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	3.926965336220245
It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson ' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission.	4.218872087300598
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	3.8872980603621743
At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before.	4.425144286294729
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	4.182602433500208
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!	2.8334044423236264
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.	3.8663071375059097
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible.	5.575019051308921
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	2.9389002980928223
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	3.7690379668669762
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time, but then it happens again.	3.911154078316919
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	3.6481380006177218
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	4.176866518465802
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.	5.204637683567402
Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth.	3.8357012480583044
To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights.	2.955041697356864
Direct business to consumer contact will supplement, and sometimes also reduce, the currently, nearly exclusive business to business relationship.	2.2493956286971737
I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	3.802205515892904
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.	1.9221590186697566
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.	3.3969625315551664
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.	3.4433389976264923
Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives.	2.5806692634490904
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs Wallström; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	4.513792727922002
More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right.	3.4071555959928337
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur ' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	3.807230608623355
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights.	4.44839191556466
BSE has certainly not gone away.	2.42397514781941
Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge.	2.172725853486982
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	3.815048737716576
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.	3.3377284452351987
Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations.	5.20258947062019
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	4.065979081476904
Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.	3.444373410043096
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	4.335473707280487
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	3.366015145743211
Mr President, Mrs Karamanou ' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact.	4.662347016077411
Andersson report (A5-0033/2000)	2.261480042462736
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter.	3.392735501500176
Where would Europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture?	3.6477620723947712
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	4.375284530265362
In June of last year Europe 's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	3.798710318022455
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	3.235089858711781
I think that he is correct in this regard.	3.734830586294447
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	3.372272125473667
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.	5.516076222608535
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention.	3.6277615723411625
As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task.	4.26401300887481
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.	3.9872405518686795
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard.	3.960505197246537
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.	3.813925647961508
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	5.097060833407199
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite!	5.025594328704948
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	3.912751965871485
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	3.1136825840652156
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.	4.4325451371055
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect.	3.608418331799559
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.	3.2567521108758144
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur.	3.6074860321055415
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.	4.126753701630635
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?	4.096565877087341
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.	2.2259762792184623
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.	4.354812735414162
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	4.8009354017868215
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.	4.771811043108164
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.	3.553268066529896
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.	5.965656462341878
I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects.	4.070481174088754
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	4.876688220051788
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country.	3.816582111297226
On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway.	3.574670190682543
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.	6.064315782371093
Neither is correct.	2.822911547181579
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	4.341385621043809
In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.	3.1575962861305698
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.	5.489879123115107
The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now.	5.447689016519399
Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair ' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council ' s macho position on Austria.	3.8970464179446545
We know what actually happened.	4.493717783453919
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	3.26872542796985
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	2.8969743622134945
Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.	4.0968639921528505
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	4.165110199931464
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	3.1265589957967337
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted, local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux. The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans.	3.2821360995332
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision.	3.9650725840955174
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	3.7899159499200383
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law.	3.922943053601394
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years ' imprisonment.	3.6576435089371424
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	3.6074999824453253
As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan.	3.414462820161561
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.	5.969633815092763
the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Council, on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax	3.2291110503683647
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11, except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months, as I explained just now.	3.073223875842208
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	3.1567005140091604
It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire.	5.266054609196314
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission ' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them.	5.884665029301046
The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa.	4.345122265990942
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.	4.361685714854397
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	4.081601984949971
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that, in exchange for the Golan Heights, all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt.	3.1359387640795022
Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children.	4.151912774669146
In any event, the outcome is in your hands.	4.033017231378665
Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate.	3.6523612434297834
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.	5.338239415502883
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office.	3.1900983998658443
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	4.6314574309482355
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	4.743383747692601
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	4.214610256151808
Having said this, the EU ' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region.	3.3581428210090594
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.	4.439353001528791
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity.	5.166781674077926
The human rights policy is also too selective.	5.86860824161228
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	3.9220273517295796
In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.	3.9433436648436087
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently.	4.915271138313991
We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.	4.152406608095573
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.	3.4245259047159107
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	4.564301505598547
Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated.	2.8743141932857013
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.	2.465547979420287
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union ' s policies.	4.400041310652496
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period.	4.651643818405649
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.	3.5587379555361798
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	3.4914884784392415
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	4.667019864032004
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	3.4995602579988025
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	4.334296377655419
Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union.	3.6422649689893283
I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area.	3.794628551260864
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner ' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	4.009004817154307
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020.	4.050484569229056
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency.	2.668841545004704
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	3.783553166203927
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	4.049746091574985
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.	3.878326572162692
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.	4.571345620511373
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances.	3.432965865920654
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	5.106039656990808
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.	4.613453332603067
ACP-EU Joint Assembly	3.0248700316898525
I know that this is somewhat controversial, particularly, because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime.	4.8964616352825505
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.	4.702640855162689
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	2.1205767639650537
That is the one word I am talking about.	4.30296078674873
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol.	4.018714223991362
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	3.404825807098804
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	4.094877403479338
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.	3.3882183140303304
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however.	3.1986999645998613
We are discussing last year ' s discharge, but also the Commission ' s responsibility.	5.0150310182535405
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	4.6746182804030845
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament.	3.7139560903700124
It will have to initiate these negotiations.	6.003589019769918
In other words, social security is a factor of production.	4.084831361991706
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.	3.5043961598473437
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.	4.641031360078461
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	4.251488891905784
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough.	4.346651206051358
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	4.456070050247859
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	4.356577619709091
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.	3.0980797362178234
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.	5.226793110749988
It would weaken a key element of European policy.	3.76762193978679
Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past.	3.4626317924869947
In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law.	4.66712417221612
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	4.103275957429035
. (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.	3.0498255148045206
However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus.	4.9068496555856935
That concludes the debate.	1.9556947861217602
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive.	4.54989213557921
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.	6.237603153302799
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system.	4.502899569392351
I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Knörr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency.	3.7260299935348526
Rather, the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me.	2.5169888895406074
On the other hand, the decision to delay the second round of talks, initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic, is undoubtedly significant, but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed.	3.294472875456509
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	3.634355564720814
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.	3.707769615544041
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	3.64764837451778
Commission 's strategic objectives and legislative programme	3.0781709962170325
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic, social and environmental sectors.	4.2785647658986665
This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.	4.769037629531594
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives.	4.3334657802118555
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.	4.002588111666855
The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	4.910046658675248
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us.	3.7778377541249637
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	4.714972086046845
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.	4.637636709282731
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.	2.8315220978839286
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	4.272869280561838
All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole.	3.363640268947048
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.	4.4488295088476315
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	4.056919247411209
Europe ' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military ' role of the Union.	3.234112604233104
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hudghton, also for this report.	2.916992566402959
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	3.848365576036647
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	4.313852223280508
The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans.	3.971424970370929
But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes.	3.495729455430895
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	3.231290339645354
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?	3.4495312924993558
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not.	3.5778412084455753
He is not stupid. Certainly not!	2.5059122568333674
Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable.	3.0815498790037776
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.	3.957252873020879
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	3.5614527589757783
We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is.	4.826214838138771
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	3.3445945731153395
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	5.3855590011147125
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive.	3.6350721582188052
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	4.012744169229933
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission 's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam?	4.210145121229635
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	3.6997601894677112
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.	3.2220879149843586
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement.	3.9528701715628163
The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7.	4.02138807818849
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	3.7192171412648225
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	4.03933781162786
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	3.396045323408972
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.	4.778534672908896
The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain.	3.6513490358149663
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.	2.8077325328211393
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.	3.192196985748609
I am a European and even a federalist.	6.3343868198501525
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.	2.850683849020888
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished.	4.2879486649106395
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment.	2.790190487279402
There are two fundamental questions in particular.	3.231722978131125
The vote will take place at 12 noon.	3.142534748427153
In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable.	3.5741132389630703
However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances.	3.7496767236538484
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	4.685953613596251
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	3.467062949199044
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	5.338176709052783
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, .	3.806810520894935
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.	3.9101890852847303
How can we do this?	3.001954340438521
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union ' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants ' incomes.	3.4681981805144453
I think the statement ' s content makes this clear.	4.18497276987564
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	3.21252426419516
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts.	4.927090525005306
Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important.	3.4292690038126854
The Committee on the Environment ' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation.	4.393094470341833
This is what our European 'Culture 2000 ' programme offers.	3.7969353056773527
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	4.902556967990374
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States ' programmes?	5.191017772481278
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	2.2637003855167386
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres.	4.045876411060784
That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment.	3.5253003631867865
The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone.	3.4840882753354356
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.	3.9749030572128516
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue.	4.033999579537859
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.	3.7597700070656934
Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens.	4.194649539971578
That would seem odd to me.	3.4655859762045713
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	4.348712991762657
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time.	3.499249939689441
In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process.	4.201676031820955
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political.	3.55980204958087
That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	3.4769709871517374
At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today.	3.3259182033472277
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.	3.729356615463016
Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax.	3.9567095936653436
We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity.	3.797620923944589
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs.	4.689640255768798
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	3.2079503617288534
We are now unable to guide the peace.	3.673640558738993
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough.	4.037089140677546
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	3.6084811343087435
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals.	3.544964455858939
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.	4.219895097651363
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member ' s first question and the supplementary question.	4.098093478602588
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote.	4.689907221043926
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.	3.7500001946756827
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle.	2.2849362694013493
Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report.	4.862006623479899
The polluter ought to pay.	5.040765615247938
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	4.061602436347024
Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind.	3.518364162557288
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped.	3.339603531583881
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika.	3.5226131787637414
In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work.	3.546869634334864
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.	3.8735864307072663
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol.	4.91602883731365
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	4.2373481802790565
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE.	4.984290520928115
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	3.995873887766475
As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value.	3.6519871232909176
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see.	4.483407599885815
We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board.	3.4507809766895607
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	4.008733146559548
I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick.	4.306927305200739
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.	3.5850743089640003
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent.	3.239825554475717
Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office.	3.4031374515633033
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	4.583719031121092
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.	4.02899240634354
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	3.377098345067016
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	4.307723105874564
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.	3.5820871024985723
I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work.	3.515607522277652
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	5.049468743417348
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone.	3.8077982621374233
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues.	4.867022441553421
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.	2.9592927030797664
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.	4.6333495236153075
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	4.130533790100446
However, according to the SCRS study, the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries.	3.698491265921074
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty.	4.052719856549837
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.	5.11731696476358
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.	5.007994672121608
There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived.	3.4281672218118024
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	3.2381469045426448
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	3.0174275948788907
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	5.09725741617059
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.	4.362100037813176
Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport.	3.081159436740687
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution.	4.291655600022656
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.	3.6805315523439917
(FR) The Lomé Convention, on which the entire structure of relations between the European Union and the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries rests, is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north-south relations.	3.4178994766580804
Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union ' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia ' .	3.337768980336057
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	1.989084347219329
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged.	4.23151936587561
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.	3.556332725276266
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	2.982991370847066
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	3.430152134492263
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country.	3.8691005929257614
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	4.285765693809892
Five months are provided for this.	2.247685078689504
Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens ' rights are only respected within sovereign states.	3.938000612133749
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.	6.261834510587421
We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.	4.084291145614099
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	3.6536132524586904
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	2.868766586890787
Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom.	3.5385873904742984
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	3.6131390425122967
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	4.289002735631623
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.	3.5720813451126063
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	6.796995445131933
In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic.	3.035374365308896
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.	2.5468761364122185
The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical.	4.65992390061397
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	4.315198181312839
The challenge was immense.	6.258769389007518
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.	5.047104895231541
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.	4.359912099095401
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards.	3.713318247027397
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.	4.2821357916884155
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because, by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU, their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition, they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways.	3.0959476652777584
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry!	4.294735234700157
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	3.6882754489605483
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.	4.446012661079369
Nothing has changed there.	2.1930126082024617
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.	3.606499384897529
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	4.059218690555312
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.	3.8496213762298086
Let the managers manage.	3.9503668194081585
Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields.	4.839404807325013
Ten years ago, the "velvet revolution" proclaimed Havel na HRAD.	2.458767651153109
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	3.5795573918432084
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	4.163604957085383
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	4.1098696491517295
We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	2.873444987263171
Why am I stressing this point?	3.592896530899374
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women ' s participation in the political decision-making process.	4.173888584678317
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO ' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces.	4.198978104131532
There may be a number of views on that.	5.210677534809735
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.	4.135951485862735
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report.	2.987014307388448
The text is overambitious, and Britain ' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	4.554922907329105
That is in line with the draft resolution.	3.5560494909916254
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	2.5848129203733965
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation, the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster.	4.02377976840815
When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed.	5.49815189271818
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission ' s viewpoint.	4.833785075688155
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.	2.6151933764708364
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	4.164900565833402
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	4.34561516474354
This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.	3.7197577456178514
In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.	3.681802161329035
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively.	4.518458217482653
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.	4.042578950272882
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	4.287478197794882
I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe.	4.505005571434693
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive.	3.110706445860599
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard.	3.8799164311784327
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.	3.5432633904519797
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner ' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region ' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	3.706651160697529
Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities.	4.016493745628895
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned.	4.31503945497165
You must understand that a presidency ' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.	3.3919845146330285
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):	2.5191952502219266
This would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future.	4.117344219878354
For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding.	2.9288918074078047
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	3.8146526044277556
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.	4.323905577376341
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	3.7027588241771126
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship.	3.744299415121278
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession.	3.689910774248727
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	3.8896339840374248
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	3.419959144925412
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission ' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field.	5.24948459702931
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	3.3322163244893184
Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.	2.833206820818551
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.	3.0289965686087386
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.	3.865989845093577
I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces.	4.465450411682986
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	4.60643449146506
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy.	3.253856104874079
The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise.	3.560828717936155
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	5.268687516066982
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction.	4.344844906524132
There were women everywhere.	4.377392331413817
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep.	4.730067188772197
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays ' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	4.025711107984866
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.	3.304609158676219
They will need time to get used to that too.	3.397275632950046
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.	4.025023278043196
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers.	3.709863273487033
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.	3.3176795163505792
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe, which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, in February 2000.	5.13089901335969
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.	4.939622363279508
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee.	4.862606303432375
Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.	3.5656690542733758
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	4.34512590796169
However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA.	3.8948840972678593
Mr President in office, ladies and gentlemen, I have great honour in extending a warm welcome, on behalf of the House, to the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Havel.	4.160696136352941
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	4.045077398266043
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians.	3.9106894606981784
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.	2.8271643737930545
The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable.	3.991319292035303
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	3.813061673876381
One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated.	3.9293968269427673
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro!	4.3412679391499704
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.	2.9517476819741337
This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done.	3.3177011228748277
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	3.374215291921696
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.	4.232734309764559
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development.	3.265213902434717
This is why I give this report my full support.	3.4018181469865114
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.	3.3527141915001817
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	3.6435752147715124
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne 's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.	3.681555093994626
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports.	3.819909219943954
It is thus not confined to EC activities.	4.29939599344181
You have not integrated it anywhere.	2.994582437194404
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.	4.4815020572833655
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union ' s status in the world.	3.626738391885899
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	3.0773889583682585
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.	4.202244237581413
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support.	4.147422159595825
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	3.3499548701797064
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.	3.968388342687893
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.	2.9995356164588944
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise.	3.7374355917036004
The internal market is the basis for our work.	7.612935842854045
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.	5.053418712755891
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	4.732085172109964
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	4.365990114817753
In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.	2.784011392934847
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	3.9158337423618246
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	3.135511769550718
I believe that, in accordance with Article 69 (2), we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission, and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee.	4.285093071533164
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made, we, the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common vision and, in particular, the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament.	4.980506184283289
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.	4.1133449995579925
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	4.1813629913467905
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.	3.098219512513003
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	4.622868943036916
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.	3.577200860472883
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.	4.178898663959171
Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy.	3.68287970681357
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars.	6.181970504874469
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many.	4.146550093073266
I believe that the Commission ' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter.	5.32830648033487
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	3.1627397845496934
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing.	3.6708743331261156
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	4.013924373945788
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty.	3.286598067869335
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed.	3.4593545737641525
Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark.	3.6010791657537866
I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values.	3.8313473500394153
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information.	4.204008837224051
Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made.	5.242698038292936
The challenge of enlargement is political.	4.942475169926275
Are there any comments?	1.2692975256400874
I envisage that the board 's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.	4.561292929860571
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission ' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	5.096953408432174
You are expected to ask questions, not necessarily make lengthy statements.	3.2790767531313607
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	4.010165223193848
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	2.797482240749863
Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks.	2.8361899783058595
Mr President, I just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the House also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the Austrian anti-racist associations who are honouring us with a visit.	3.7829990180633137
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	3.602119051433645
The starting point for the Commission ' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States ' being able to maintain their social security arrangements.	4.940498856277795
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement.	4.870305559230632
A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.	3.5703634888154347
On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission ' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds.	4.505116492521859
I utterly reject this!	5.732641747324512
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.	4.582160035108211
I have had a little to do with this too.	7.8680859052970975
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.	3.528390657742446
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States.	4.417603724368419
LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget, and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years. Despite the enlargement which has already taken place, when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second, despite enlargement, the level of appropriations remained the same.	3.846987335521629
I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.	3.8012036014238317
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season.	3.408027777006421
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	3.3472588826863494
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.	4.108010833020654
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous.	3.759543644930171
In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax.	3.5958697626159317
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan ' s very expert work on this report.	3.3761658120808242
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.	3.579285353013101
There is effective legal precaution.	4.02207118215424
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself.	3.6489255144079125
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	4.128448163382357
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.	4.569441521828627
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament.	4.092013096295825
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view.	4.99488789389549
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	3.936906246540651
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?	3.788421391219467
Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship.	3.6413367348992174
Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.	3.8963892630587966
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them.	3.4993115783947255
However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned.	4.804790481609081
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.	4.06418416891257
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	3.6158250407337436
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.	4.127227164995264
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.	3.5616880164824645
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument.	2.6250629604046103
As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery.	3.0887548026888907
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report.	4.431605270357239
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions.	2.9036764072846193
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	4.990389338389464
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe.	4.929432918828757
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	4.4192493040667795
Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue. If Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning, I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11(1) in particular.	3.7213052893081904
Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.	4.432423835895201
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	3.248380367661868
I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion.	4.926098455166518
But we see no reason to lower our guard.	4.052447807470815
Danube environmental disaster	2.3346267742125852
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.	3.8498936873032528
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	4.080147862420787
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently.	4.337278817194198
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.	3.1315769052267437
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.	4.370573300270069
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	3.6794030579866397
Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour ' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel.	2.5643499894917356
Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made.	3.9428270299616153
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same.	2.998817078842231
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	3.185068888623498
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	4.641965660464206
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.	4.250570253940358
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up.	3.500908404719593
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	4.086496693246399
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union ' s democratic role.	5.753820641042173
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.	4.787273674575585
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	3.519905726552927
Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.	2.8426318861302646
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.	4.307777676770978
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	3.767590574269398
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	3.323643337875337
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	4.748225271991822
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.	2.095051293389621
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	3.828418676101468
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	5.998882409876147
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes.	4.544269645345121
After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment?	3.435023411750512
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	4.564309371759632
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.	3.0847680820748984
The topic touches the very core of the European Union.	3.722678066768652
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	3.79342610361998
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	3.625239217229378
The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship.	3.8042350828262923
Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington.	3.305324220819162
It should not be in the amendment.	6.119877276017996
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	3.6096331075579022
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	4.212042583200223
Let us, in particular, focus attention on the re-admission clauses, which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked.	4.0705877562327775
I took the punishment that came to me.	5.018731750335984
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)	1.9451468837011094
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	4.136336027829703
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member.	3.542312469204859
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up.	4.531165253954437
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission.	4.191854321795147
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	3.4859723360440964
(FR) The European Union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions.	3.4104637630506622
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.	4.445212858789447
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.	3.266028119117163
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	4.8363179320440635
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	4.391374821070537
There is one wish on the European Parliament ' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies.	4.725072642007233
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable.	4.293121844918331
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	5.292076951576668
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.	3.9505405847592625
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	3.7075844561315945
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime.	4.05878931932324
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	3.3388290590957403
The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union ' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.	4.29967994914308
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.	3.7364803564803744
In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?	3.9163845300596614
The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way.	3.481978412954625
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States ' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.	4.427257787125567
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording.	4.625453073100313
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.	3.5389189106818724
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	3.9472585815441734
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.	3.883436240941746
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	5.23459517026024
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees.	5.29163780265214
I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs.	3.970974418941715
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	4.189175706371041
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change.	5.44989360318089
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	4.562542492000069
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	5.799009870856375
We must live with our consciences."	5.195038412422906
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration.	4.075430755221634
When will we debate that?	2.9436634740672956
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	4.841602169334002
Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario.	3.914914758324331
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	3.57163055833983
I am thinking in particular of countries such as Cuba which are isolated but I know, because I have travelled there extensively, that the Cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world, obtain different information and pass on different information.	3.0326589924352096
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	3.8755031288687154
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.8005890760472703
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	3.6503065780970196
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.	3.7618151019312704
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.	3.124767618670427
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	3.030010579345356
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	3.1527933574126026
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally.	3.873766122002828
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.	3.917830545834878
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	3.625388861321387
What are the Commission 's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	2.315861012965642
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.	4.56507866427348
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?	3.685437556851237
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council.	6.232955726346597
For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.	4.028842086680842
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?	4.420577216114858
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol.	2.8194475217206314
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	4.148781443803368
Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds.	2.8443912957120214
It will be a force comprised of various national units.	4.7364470068868805
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology.	3.965301320004061
I will end now.	5.5700077867265625
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person.	3.9124730047401064
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten ' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	4.424221737063349
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council 's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	3.0760879886430414
In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others.	3.627419278848738
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans.	3.8531310459629156
The main objective of the Union ' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	4.470538541989242
That is the measure of the problem.	3.0017963693446896
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them.	3.91107325615972
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals.	5.3158536421922165
This brings me to the content of the report.	3.2225424691168176
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	4.902207979919955
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.	3.597595384546729
Are there any comments?	1.2692975256400874
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors.	4.0495033619854945
I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us.	4.2477976335288945
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report, which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated.	3.766011834359661
However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives.	4.8800344732251455
Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future?	4.667493629247707
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	3.7083540125165886
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	4.997242169891446
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	3.6783640301248828
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.	3.7746641870781557
Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners?	4.91530006040253
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	3.002000431658404
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.	3.614879102257824
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.	3.5119255346625464
More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils.	3.436409806170401
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	4.64954946525892
.	1.3940351656188106
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	3.572435603370806
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.	3.1785976714599227
I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?	4.617012337354876
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( 'Culture 2000 ') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD).	1.9230662707198338
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	2.9982618335570854
Now, the concept of "uniform harmonisation" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security.	3.373533028181988
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework.	5.598180763230131
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	4.198949868715206
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?	3.727607599750559
Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union ' s postal services.	4.64244678652067
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.	3.8686401106248196
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way.	4.997873214178802
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council ' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	4.117445752284761
This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3.	3.752774603805519
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.	4.331259085192695
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.	3.7103399572801044
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?	3.7768587276025554
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before.	4.629533117636124
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work.	3.7046301041468324
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	4.475768407066604
Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed.	4.523517362223724
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion.	3.560661344892444
From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest.	3.287688998660865
The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS).	2.7308388294581167
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.	6.059113303334356
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	4.282791660884517
Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.	3.382086301952792
Overly strict, unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable.	3.734057636328669
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	3.7504099728577693
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle.	4.8341575238578
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	4.616351960359682
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	3.4180576476437947
An 's ' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta ' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta ' which is completely the contrary.	2.745524568600529
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary.	4.423935896522724
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	4.221775788424774
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	4.577872715729017
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies.	3.3304530172677373
There are huge reserves; certain zones, rural zones, so-called zones lagging behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitats, are listed as having good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism.	2.8434442186741076
Mr President, the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater, drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation.	5.688017221032604
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	4.090558780372629
We agree with many of the rapporteur ' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission ' s and the Council ' s intentions and plans concerning social protection.	4.243892693868646
Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete.	4.318549266231625
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	3.432482802134246
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	3.695638014615429
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity.	5.189113141266501
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.	5.075110689240028
This is also at the request of the citizens.	3.277028150794227
I also want to take up the subject of migration.	4.78349357153269
Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products.	3.2715660735943737
Of course, a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a network which will assist the exchange of experience.	4.260135988072551
The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless.	5.1521455901872715
The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999.	2.7407373438788043
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?	4.67853325069613
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.	4.3324241502464025
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market.	3.8928727278496353
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the European Union and helps the more or less disadvantaged, island and remote areas to stand on their own feet.	3.63244576411933
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	4.321963280193479
The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far.	4.49816842612694
Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	4.285941097005841
Most of the report is about financial control.	4.241894727702129
In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows.	4.232163998634086
This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it.	4.254977065885827
It does, however, support my view that I am not, apparently, the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion.	5.022038003283048
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	3.253177265038279
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?	3.71304008887108
The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with ' , etc.	3.506911301836762
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.	3.593077922118222
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco ' s view.	3.4895487045035622
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand.	4.646032768768672
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.	4.813447566149571
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	3.751657910805977
This is the Commission ' s own survey.	7.10888179360757
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data.	3.6047076261163125
However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.	4.136375373920663
It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time.	5.136860856189976
The French State has released funds for compensating damage.	4.103863837934527
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.	5.2668384660312215
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	3.852564568796232
Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea.	4.117867239224166
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union ' s enlargement on our structural policy.	4.641788777980657
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading.	4.205636809805317
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon.	4.246869233784652
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	4.353055608783747
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions.	3.645369655250015
Mr President, Mrs Theato ' s report on the protection of the European Union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.	4.072845142540948
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	4.2184427714774095
Securing this is a major priority.	4.132835060100178
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	3.0829680804652435
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	4.41641811370502
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions.	4.329673859822377
As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded.	4.213098286633478
At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system.	3.7670322088178847
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?	4.024202522092964
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country ' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	3.2904014918595297
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	5.010897721455069
My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.	4.075518359875181
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.	3.8088545279951735
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.	4.020269738576058
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself, and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes, included in Objectives 1 and 2, and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located.	4.360828922316781
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law.	4.821483692433752
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party ' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	3.8376927665904534
Thus, when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe.	3.5402567411618127
In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.	4.291152614978971
However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement.	4.240260984707483
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	4.631069647566813
For example, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects ' - this is an obvious issue.	3.4519656144687976
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	4.040724912027043
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.	4.4149922281353025
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support, and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response.	5.552173995113889
But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment.	4.243591570044114
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	3.695610713875331
For our part, we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere, because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union ' s image and to the Union ' s own particular identity.	4.28516554085746
For all these reasons, I think that reforming the Treaties would allow the huge tourist question, which is an important asset for the whole planet, to be properly integrated.	4.564605925069385
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	4.899362296475532
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	5.273651321703692
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol.	3.366028733689203
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union ' s relations with Cambodia.	4.378495078125415
In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological.	6.727667708874782
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	3.3173115930939447
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria ' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	3.0198827625217857
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations.	3.4223304496989346
. As regards the Commission 's position with respect to the amendments tabled by Parliament I wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this House on Tuesday, 15 February.	5.349864084603588
I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.	3.978902070047181
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	4.663022785471629
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	3.6815947870866346
I am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high-level working group report, your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy.	5.15870134496205
I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy.	3.8057084999193775
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion.	3.672850256659318
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.	4.742270489103993
Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.	3.18605915967019
But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.	3.203043138034025
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	4.918362411893447
Madam President, reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process.	3.70174297299678
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	4.096174128908678
What do they see?	3.8638442126060286
There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.	3.5479783469759205
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.	3.8060824982461625
More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective.	3.4184706655627357
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	5.367629864251846
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it.	3.602028560889864
I can understand your concern.	4.454553344851757
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union.	3.808417006713926
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	3.530705733580704
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect.	3.3335663548329415
In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.	2.9586951470748004
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide.	3.7787488947658567
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission ' s proposal on Mr Böge ' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	4.766095452544775
Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems.	3.514331737089366
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	3.3539692844026354
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.	3.816235118206022
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.	4.912382972065414
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures.	3.988670369350779
When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises.	4.141748193599904
If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.	3.8574056958026444
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.	3.8343155695225843
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM ' s relations with all its neighbours.	3.496487292043554
The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed.	4.173662876433508
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio ' s Amendment No 22 in both respects.	3.3742216872474833
Who would want this to happen?	3.016843298564963
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe 's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.	3.738856076241775
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.	3.5815417177560054
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought.	4.9810439363840775
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	3.849808434052351
Finally, a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report.	3.4519768907667348
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events.	3.4772700947323383
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.	3.7350744213037417
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law.	5.518710829930553
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.	3.2760985947172347
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	3.8828007501948885
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.	4.775179358583633
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and, on the other, more widespread exclusion.	4.201692021138195
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole.	3.8379764463682693
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.	4.337325122856228
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.	3.7904730954280006
My second point concerns the safety of these plants.	3.415565825436273
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.	3.494003316331252
As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	3.5207267372273368
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	5.015367551293113
In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable.	4.1710255954271584
After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies.	3.489647624788974
We should get it into perspective.	4.816538025462032
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible.	3.3541411872084264
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions.	4.434931143430843
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	4.3673867232823484
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	3.076901668960408
In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million.	3.1877661459726356
Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments.	4.0820754112701225
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity.	4.5582859900627914
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries.	3.881904494424077
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	3.9132825434621363
This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures.	3.054858885596456
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	4.467412408290387
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	4.477769813909424
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	3.8440504436829688
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite.	3.581133158011937
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?	4.214361391395768
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	4.936083382658189
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP).	2.8657999661375957
I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way.	4.502636875315183
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	4.384913918021716
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud ' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services.	5.1667881360841665
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature.	5.495818488347467
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK.	4.090485166122503
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	4.255388346054747
Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.	3.6681848561877493
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	4.194107440102133
We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future.	3.8466004117769126
We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"	3.304074332155866
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now.	3.3421569016164088
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	4.232018379157626
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets.	3.9790317077068686
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	3.4489477514044733
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.	5.049485126622669
What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at Sète or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it.	2.797240187668193
However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.	4.028121237189742
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems.	3.213929719857515
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.	4.285791546982323
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community 's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	4.635367121242737
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.	3.538255030691836
It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries, but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge.	4.858062220930299
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	2.9266501557397087
The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice.	3.739425475538307
So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place.	4.042113370321239
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.	3.0936591867493113
This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue.	4.594270987400453
Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics.	4.043465553390824
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible.	3.712562791694752
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts.	2.414201121823033
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO ' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.	3.8006129351176168
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.	3.2904929948551938
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments ' ability to act and within the scope of the Council.	4.665817198125984
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	5.482740799260168
However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy.	4.828694584788486
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	3.4906165346155564
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy.	5.7616403341076925
Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.	3.5954468624800087
Commissioner, it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe, men and women, are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations.	4.395721808914658
We have to lay down the rules of play today, before we all lose.	4.485465386341715
Agenda	1.0709171446689894
Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.	4.29273919265122
What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	2.607477734415995
Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis.	3.3415718722382595
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	3.043729565757185
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.	3.5867206970124212
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	5.18699633664086
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition ' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	3.8853567670705202
Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	3.44803787053171
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.	3.229869887840064
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.	3.657078953084054
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	4.2491533860865385
Not that we do so every week.	4.770730995821173
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	2.673935477378403
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	4.259114265999557
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.	5.458965701956682
I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.	5.1671268837454525
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.	3.6970359413138163
the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Commission, on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax.	3.114524298332687
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance.	4.196654080872216
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	4.532568891394273
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper.	3.145438987783386
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	4.188119510756408
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	3.3640619982968754
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	3.4139679934333715
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	3.199606323257071
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	4.1290015678922245
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	3.933279830037424
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.	3.4990056699799887
We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc.	3.739194811710647
- (FR) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science ' .	3.521748490792326
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	4.257557730999989
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.	6.214189056447317
Underground networks?	1.7424852387148428
It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area.	4.31977956449273
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made.	4.2289904750367295
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	4.40720810543431
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.	4.491627905761222
With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.	4.07892982595819
Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example, how much progress are you willing to make and what measures, legislative or otherwise, will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings, child pornography on the Internet, drugs, and organised crime?	2.9891659529216623
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out.	4.224722820869517
1997 discharge	2.791044875917158
I say they have a right to solidarity.	5.569630125251367
Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country 's respect for and adherence to human rights.	2.45764728453646
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	3.5472705634775727
But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses.	3.827418635744751
The Commission must continue along these lines.	4.365376491681756
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.	4.251491684704312
It is downright scandalous what goes on!	3.707600267643659
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.	3.4290962743622067
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem.	3.9770443489958347
As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal.	4.384541864420487
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials ' with 'government officials ' .	2.287080947717704
(Applause from the PSE Group)	1.1675143331948095
Under the European Community ' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	3.0049908535836507
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.	5.079528244314091
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	5.310244657868934
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.	4.166528826589775
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far, perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks.	4.158164765167855
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	3.205272425633247
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	4.534290759594019
As Vaclav Havel rightly said today, the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual.	4.6045487265327605
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	4.089052537624814
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.	3.9043322128041056
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.	4.294765515095812
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47.	4.600456945362655
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	3.476405956946057
Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these.	3.2072504841335423
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	6.569498437740734
With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area, cities are at the forefront of economic, social and cultural change in Europe.	3.6335661476387338
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3811274786686611
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important.	5.091234846188328
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.	4.0465951125760595
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	2.7946171663656556
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	3.448630135208661
And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard.	3.849096471977266
I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.	4.4544665800956835
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention.	4.409643783057535
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ?	3.618610424984561
Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start.	3.880385609462117
Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.	4.00345744941715
We need to look very carefully at those.	4.027986116574323
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price.	4.247935868760845
Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.	4.4590650701252805
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.	4.5334324603202845
Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time.	3.036117155642188
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	3.672423832353101
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament ' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	3.7826291063907633
The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.	4.438169965832369
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.	3.8779307767711586
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982.	3.9480424933639924
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party.	3.4713822741102365
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.	2.8345415627137114
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months ' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	3.194777041086695
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity.	3.4505240475490817
Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere.	3.860474959499645
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	3.7264329926531277
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	3.982678529623914
I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries.	4.701955602854965
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.	3.521815416019058
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people.	3.5989094442720413
The United Nation ' s, and Mr Kouchner ' s, mission in Kosovo ended in failure.	3.7910374715700246
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva.	5.314881840619545
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.	3.723684227525981
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	3.720885718430543
For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.	4.575713128313063
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.	4.940197898760919
Should we complain about this delay?	2.580016312269435
What is a fair society?	4.2880644449042
But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol.	3.643532248404766
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.	4.013236978065131
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	3.6040013750700495
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.	4.101509877656375
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.	4.191286290736607
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	4.259259619599009
The last century was marked by three periods.	4.463792202124096
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?	4.1855704216592775
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	3.5289602996783387
This report is about the Commission.	4.80974478142205
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU 's areas of competence.	3.4480081314942734
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	2.90215983693872
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war.	3.4249684012454953
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	3.56469383295073
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.	3.7995912344836427
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	3.582878763829418
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check.	3.4117531158407566
This is not covered by the directive.	3.8222017146708134
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament 's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	4.758164328463117
There, it is mainstreaming which applies.	2.5036876419168976
What concrete measures have been discussed?	4.328180418612351
Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.	4.182033854069
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	2.2998621574181075
What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years?	5.2558918812095
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.	3.5934810451384833
In other words, accession should not be held hostage to a political solution.	3.8742917727905235
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	3.934420826463559
I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament ' s Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair.	3.262453237666902
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	4.021228249214467
It is, of course, a peace process which is finally under way.	3.7805500760865844
One is to adopt the Commission ' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible.	4.1378684216459005
. (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists.	4.752687900987571
I therefore wonder whether the Commission ' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation.	4.589779767015342
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met.	4.049535362503064
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.	5.147637867967871
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.	4.293852164603951
In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system.	3.9409679117821934
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context.	4.816870900155354
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union ' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.	4.251012608682637
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	4.432075621025155
This is my first additional question.	3.8794970432515905
The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs.	5.966443159556961
The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency ' s statement of 1 February 2000.	4.153105876780475
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	4.748022744206675
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	2.7575028113488953
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	3.634028875881207
Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out.	2.3107112688698805
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	3.6428235915481673
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	4.985848844196997
I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions.	4.79267403053254
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe?	2.5845342504347673
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	3.729185205355959
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	4.705104689455142
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.	5.034403565177176
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.	3.3720308674290096
They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels.	4.0386176357869115
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.	2.512636116070662
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010, but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend.	4.439486331236999
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	4.762970664025461
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House, namely to introduce such an area.	5.383324162422522
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	3.920624239157257
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model.	3.503073671159059
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	3.302673098286714
In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked.	4.451558370072546
We are a group of unity in diversity.	4.713668144493337
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	4.999235483268901
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this.	3.838033661783711
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner ' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover.	3.9142724956462978
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	3.512864730091743
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	2.399569135409737
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed.	1.8775223687129037
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	2.7371178757995254
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	3.797999026759514
Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions.	4.333937522402827
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.	3.94338214301146
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	3.6985153820406644
We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson ' s report.	3.846041038857193
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.	4.969682959388436
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	4.871083685697129
There have already been hundreds of deaths.	5.552878331160917
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	3.40674402378679
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	2.4285736040155648
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.	3.813983629076951
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model.	3.1943773022970183
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	2.2218036765182454
. (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	4.035204634858159
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.	3.4264307133419183
Question No 8 by (H-0042/00):	2.4827124718907734
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States.	4.09309768075829
It is also 'confusing ' .	3.490682116599219
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA.	3.458917599863134
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	3.206526828376244
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	3.654779523953184
This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances.	3.7281146954061115
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.	3.6252489288201035
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce.	5.969952994503161
According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned.	3.5254724425171053
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	3.566503724781113
I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market.	4.077416040255779
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	4.482635224805172
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.	3.916821012361558
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.	3.330939249862412
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	4.554704023447254
To identify the EC 's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community 's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions.	5.310999314854109
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now.	3.4334314195224493
Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.	4.7396577144617025
There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster.	3.161695911898765
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	5.270233599678374
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	3.1120191902062286
There is huge duplication of effort.	3.71772196114988
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal.	3.5271893382359867
(Applause from the left. Heckling from the right)	2.3602486483535596
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness.	4.331568388678161
The time for action is upon us.	4.4601673221632545
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	4.206890676351236
I have a related point.	5.171640605640133
But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this.	4.547953998240738
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	4.266304173807715
Do we have the results of this impact study?	4.593103616532321
Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time.	2.3193403004240603
It is very helpful.	4.88244500723041
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	5.025397657593937
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly.	4.007736351668013
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute ' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	4.383960378506157
In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.	4.009433651434162
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	4.058395731664325
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement, and this relates to Turkey ' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession.	3.7463412234949445
More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States ' ratification.	4.146537170524891
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.	3.4891048946827037
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU.	3.581903163974486
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	3.4185798527476274
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	4.259950647839752
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.	4.6341967997377
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.	3.6080204941475986
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine.	3.7142289444672096
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro ' s report.	3.228701003485658
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion.	3.8391920356948144
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.	3.0891307512796318
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM	2.7950317177266264
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	3.366315064053924
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	4.011720882561979
This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	4.324077595948548
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	4.216899679588032
However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis.	3.7880378619429527
In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is.	4.183775804327757
So let us contact the United States now!	4.334062352529869
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.	3.326726709160479
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility.	4.867333367625527
Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one ' s own money for the purposes of one ' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.	4.151678508053826
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent.	3.6318827169324246
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies.	5.04349769856571
Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests can be guaranteed.	5.124597369823857
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.	4.457164174524535
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions.	3.887123754873399
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	4.218835605407115
On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note.	3.41759032862952
This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation.	5.334223216804469
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation.	3.414089485700643
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary.	3.713107545750525
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	3.9672366673993507
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.	4.586783385370151
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork.	4.098639229187489
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds.	3.404986928502422
So the "Grappa War" is over.	2.8253115484636506
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out.	3.436231818389886
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.	2.837813765775911
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.7729642561226249
.	1.3940351656188106
Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	4.602957275713085
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	3.615367190591654
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	3.9657278476327864
This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union.	4.056726210567519
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.	5.712632835487498
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet.	3.4394343174062154
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	2.5359561995782736
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.	4.418332037438023
Are there any comments?	1.2692975256400874
This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe.	3.712394093519826
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	4.352355405724115
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	3.407210251648048
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree.	5.504008542921034
A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	4.104345211189743
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses.	3.175219567543922
In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model ' s approach, which is one based on solidarity.	4.61692288561536
Personally, I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this.	3.836675841748756
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.	3.9423540134542434
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.	5.18335832813564
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	4.146447503009488
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	3.6036569420079747
Report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)	1.9411457348967924
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing.	4.943937493637417
Mr Nielson, what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy.	5.380940242881863
Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy.	2.8455018916790378
From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer.	4.972998272188333
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?	4.146878357550582
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.	4.284938720047416
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	3.91451418070069
As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika.	4.413225704370407
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law.	3.0561102517267433
Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate.	2.7423395127311982
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	4.074614369324961
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	3.154063972904129
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised.	4.0967320535281475
At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated.	3.6112135057349675
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	3.9861048779785415
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	4.375288844496594
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	3.559972863086352
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	3.642624480772331
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets.	4.320077960416138
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time!	3.966151785092681
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive.	4.147022049056029
However, it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union.	4.753075669960879
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences.	2.9594399018835484
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.	3.0032830574717795
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	4.474442588663521
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.	4.2338579090997435
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those.	4.679632051128347
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	3.4102574169953606
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.143383233916123
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.	2.7056662052758678
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content.	3.772563797212298
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.	3.800455983968274
No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other.	3.152945938859846
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation.	3.0283534832260863
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.	3.5553351016170325
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.	3.7050323403615977
The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination.	4.1516527093755355
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders.	5.734280811394491
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	3.900455287523202
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	4.02166257817061
First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague ' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.	3.7325693351574736
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world ' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	3.2264689288199033
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie ' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.	4.092127418584151
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	4.69446320061893
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.	2.172347433338127
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	4.294812788042537
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of.	4.6988318557560005
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	3.895420081622083
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area.	3.5404139816096216
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	4.000858807208876
After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour.	3.54244522196163
The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income.	4.037100124575068
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	3.817250067212166
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.	3.198393843960158
Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work.	5.201268499747357
Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident.	5.095331925928177
This is a big task but it can be done.	4.1142524935119855
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.	3.8843212698182152
This question needs to be resolved urgently.	7.1970666756972514
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	4.923966480637711
Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China.	3.585259546861631
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	3.977855660178808
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.	4.916984917899772
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society.	4.381448545774612
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this.	3.136818040508954
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach.	4.399623211110315
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.	4.892649679466241
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.	4.038932159894824
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	3.7583815006756107
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	3.361970027302877
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	4.074437511634168
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	3.604176691520403
We need a public debate on this.	4.229107631961885
I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society.	4.457913668801699
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.	3.7656392038317716
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.	3.6136404742353756
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission ' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	3.36861774365211
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	3.401170083259162
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	3.7236605351392424
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances.	2.915679219945784
This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.	4.944154867503747
But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness.	3.4646778981168027
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure.	4.264134578540204
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.	3.7608450091392505
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	4.223537314794828
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.	6.118739606373222
Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.	3.7857843950820604
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.	4.225734547457992
Let me give you three examples.	3.2343744638357426
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.	3.3619166105912366
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	3.164772931480992
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.	4.806264965108644
Subject: Commission 's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue '.	3.971858975443179
In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.	4.441217005126524
Well, they see the planet 's resources being unevenly spread.	3.0104972866802187
We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument.	5.4730446207490475
In the middle of an election campaign, a series of authorities, all of them run by the party in government, made clearly electioneering speeches which, furthermore, were broadcast live on television.	3.3391325010071036
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.	2.7454129154296294
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	3.945649981518895
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	3.526346042315881
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community ' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.	3.9363429580179896
Question Time (Council)	2.045435526911663
Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion.	3.830840710886331
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays ' principle.	4.047091566017091
It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock.	3.2353245434933107
This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.	3.3415138848519126
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.	3.4110027185879934
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project.	4.042255226578888
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	2.959985341554401
Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient.	2.8099280029045843
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities.	3.8639837195474245
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees.	3.891319415392071
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon.	5.324353993397603
As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real.	2.8154451740299833
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson ' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission 's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	4.031762057441256
The other parties are not paying.	5.119450922985926
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	4.302686891415669
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.8463718256629875
A drop in standards should not be allowed.	3.1852655167848885
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	4.462887711827994
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.	3.328214860760214
The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme.	4.960302965182495
Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails.	4.055047253254161
We await the outcome with great interest.	3.5648842972940233
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.	4.945566171936956
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	2.664623859763088
People must realise this!	2.8363569120780068
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	3.8612551760341693
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future.	4.898579095548983
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.	5.835991701159807
However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission ' s proposal.	4.227649545809079
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.	3.9328445804328083
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	3.90672908468448
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.	2.7644965175690186
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention.	5.757020175107713
In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued.	3.6176251847095156
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	4.836230100290458
Report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)	2.0130901123157767
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	3.364289182882207
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset, it should, in my view, demonstrate this in practice.	4.510031298968099
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	4.50930382336497
Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation.	3.9057148489978246
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	3.870599882218258
Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say.	3.19963070701815
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population ' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.	4.501090423627544
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.	3.086218191049876
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	2.796347134036249
Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union.	3.693258512276018
There are a number of sound amendments.	3.6683978301218736
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL.	3.311949933135276
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	5.239828404922503
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously.	5.656571627885048
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?	3.9571322723292988
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.	4.108480691097952
This has now been done.	5.161012401391886
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.	3.835929234814965
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	3.1762520414182545
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.	5.405086810208154
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	2.0528054782973606
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	5.32663155219576
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.	2.85548835609038
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.	3.8954657285771637
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector.	3.9488008226286655
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.	2.7990910223964263
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area.	3.6521778561525657
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive.	4.274340644661501
Adjournment of the session	1.137185502920295
As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF ' s financing, or rather lack of financing.	4.099824101232846
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us, they want clarity; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote.	4.372382823148504
The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity.	4.274111086021394
Many of the report ' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.	2.805286622743778
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.	5.840787155413795
I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world.	4.5689797456921015
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	3.845712668875263
After five years only four have done so.	3.1168816826123744
It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice.	3.8234536423083654
We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State, which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature.	4.475584249977969
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis.	4.038471504634927
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU.	3.08932829801617
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	4.8704587435992535
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.	4.579239043792364
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	3.697649563697376
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	4.020958259000744
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning.	4.996177696056881
What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme?	4.297525448167367
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	4.57990026950825
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.	3.500002501918463
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner?	3.20931401339863
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen ' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.	4.539460413916536
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	3.624520827816616
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	4.07660682606208
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	3.4713094589087
As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.	3.2221855454861177
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier ' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.	4.798792098389925
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale.	3.13895685973344
I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.	4.623191825567478
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.	3.5635666973828677
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.	3.89045000873944
The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR.	4.192528651125547
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	3.934600011217696
So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.	3.9816762056642383
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People ' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent.	4.2225093102603575
We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat.	3.852356794919002
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	4.899000245453509
And yet our President is a fine economist.	4.030195926680869
Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it?	3.605418190607537
However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	3.601830828602247
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	3.5633320361870067
I am also saying this as a former environment minister.	5.194013909964832
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.	5.019103419824523
I hope that the Commission will not forget that.	4.820953561736202
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	4.522009732464812
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	3.411800270542731
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives.	4.043253487473218
VOTE	1.083590840144401
That is something we must guard against.	3.421289645878528
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	3.711224779955873
(FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed.	3.9921319897760945
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	3.7654073039770437
In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable.	5.868040376952227
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.	4.40451673445339
However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union ' s most important programmes.	5.715653253018434
However, it is important, at least in Finland, as a sustainably used, slowly renewable energy source.	3.583019207796756
I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.	4.637278185496083
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low.	3.6540409288287203
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	4.632890937768686
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.	3.7927852234101307
. (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.	4.879239427305575
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	3.0778094287691395
(In successive votes, Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)	2.1585797167730165
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.	3.752909882030222
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	3.8957533007699823
Aquaculture should also be monitored.	2.7649310765991473
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	3.5544154268731174
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.	5.732810154591051
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.	4.919996936535372
Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands.	4.341733060811858
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	1.554147740218332
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	3.066597042248916
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.081684619817497
I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy.	5.477685750281586
Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species.	3.2738212675436955
I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones.	3.451594522772385
Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations.	4.306361228213373
Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income.	4.550081951192913
A large section of the Union ' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.	4.270661008583552
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	4.361732627795439
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	4.0901504504186414
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	3.261811746689517
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold.	3.538711929486696
Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets.	3.8095105267100275
Are you aware of this?	2.7298141593572076
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today?	7.735223096356529
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."	3.09806775565553
The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve.	3.2639840075074256
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.	3.4355434011594186
It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing.	3.748410310937385
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	3.693068291223814
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	3.4035729292894383
This directive is a contribution to this.	4.22435191420793
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today.	3.4450644560565524
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	3.5345219039338422
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned.	4.401429922359147
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	3.3780303921774024
It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits.	3.610770120968691
What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability?	3.608573036690168
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project, which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire, to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex.	2.6915116603628277
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	3.212515719111171
The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity.	3.9842850444422075
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels ' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.	3.8559857102623663
There must also be savings.	4.509269173478899
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	4.490759197477597
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too.	3.9340023034410425
Hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible, which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable, and I have in mind, in particular, the references that many Members have made to China.	4.379545653711822
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	3.5520402697959543
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.	5.031834991809909
At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	3.1100505125946314
Thirdly: the extension to Parliament ' s rights in this context.	3.259154522941884
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	4.975234164652184
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.	2.9747761995154947
	1.0363974359942942
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	3.372943943678096
Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament.	4.506139065748823
President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans.	3.4744109974254163
Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.	5.110689902735363
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed.	3.8281004601643365
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.	3.103604448742454
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.	3.2469785184115914
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	4.313153369216095
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.	3.1138335915778814
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement.	3.600297807389055
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative.	4.098936439706117
The project has been long and problematic.	5.802648598824544
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	3.814438260969859
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.	4.148476385456067
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union.	3.596938161204775
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma.	3.248341454051478
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	3.5827137069729207
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.	4.463490639137831
And there are more and more of us in the world.	4.619383087118934
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors ' need for protection and security.	3.242002461532884
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.	4.95344578093199
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles.	5.257357204642444
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):	2.367505394392421
Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member.	3.51010432670996
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	5.414915776400811
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.	5.5681654450848415
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years ' worth of experience.	4.696945968565793
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	3.490406333667535
This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken.	3.831021168922353
I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which, in my view, need clarifying.	4.754891199830872
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.	3.9008299610736263
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.	3.8686212437147103
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.	3.5834648720307656
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives.	3.311779914823093
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?	3.4982145964937663
Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency.	3.302324010731086
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.	4.925101421390635
In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature.	5.810236630358279
I urge the House to support these changes.	5.271608589686018
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States.	3.0993122982357963
For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	3.0740159933904563
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe.	3.247946371971589
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	3.435288142497403
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation ' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	3.5709463921692435
We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels.	3.8916286002616927
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy.	5.554645538628551
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions.	4.82396521099584
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	3.2068695651191006
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.	3.4380341906592857
Resumption of the session	1.0952419733067078
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.	3.604327205708732
In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient.	4.602449849890592
It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues.	5.5093196217342095
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements.	4.213715340551341
Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime, including by Europol and Eurojust.	2.9912583800095924
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	4.228735041255497
That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house ' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years!	3.244425457420589
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	4.685456281239932
Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen ' s document on the Steel Aid Code.	3.8435008495758596
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997.	2.8418391065303306
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	4.750838618578302
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals.	5.185856927432894
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	4.555826990467395
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion.	3.6338464976238147
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	4.314072287101622
Two things, and Mrs Theato ' s report clearly spells these out.	3.395655954716534
Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities.	3.4602126963354434
Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric.	4.578661269160855
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened.	3.855027383180353
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.	3.8389690609389513
As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character.	3.0628619662889354
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee.	3.998158267405364
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	4.18262624776596
Unfortunately not all, but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it: Italians want to see what the English are like, the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins.	3.603677086986789
Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question.	4.178648136833282
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies.	4.160488152554518
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission.	2.3455578467981333
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.	4.579124349198917
Most of Parliament ' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive.	3.893765093717425
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth.	2.9704882605918854
However, I do want to listen to all the points of view.	3.836328021255907
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States.	3.5795664151184727
This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail.	3.540521197237526
For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.	2.726497313440442
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	3.6722530280676473
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	4.661725412763837
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	1.8293961929451696
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society ' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU ' s control.	3.9515075341780426
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	5.141076028212488
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	3.633804059388859
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.	3.8577154956253916
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.5033529389158162
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.	7.821844624274795
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé, preferential access is only for "essentially all the products of the least-developed countries" .	3.6300876894842884
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.	4.387542358667298
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.	3.963283310618371
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission.	4.782326167831953
I think this is a good agreement.	5.5992600107423645
.	1.3940351656188106
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	3.33699400344364
Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.	3.4750163200835322
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe.	3.38649934807524
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	3.191182168060408
Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.	2.8602371228046066
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	4.287128294052826
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	2.8777371670475946
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	3.4956561687771757
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.	2.5869432215642925
For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission.	3.2702346379237057
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.	3.524901099571514
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.	4.546168491620922
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned.	5.064779075408535
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.8005890760472703
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken.	4.899175730073816
Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us.	3.640141535207297
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.	4.0055472430450845
Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda.	3.626887294290214
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.	4.341797629462975
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament ' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	6.2580883038808
Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen ' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement.	3.7917351130955357
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation.	4.30252651326756
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	4.418564211721276
During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon.	3.88501948210897
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	5.3252528856382435
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	4.253389764152144
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.	4.105761542724435
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	4.19492879047436
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	4.417168047322412
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.	3.663941649328969
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	4.1664873503078566
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	3.2193716735871134
The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.	4.0266149773206275
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives.	3.9388110388551927
In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy.	3.401130561494569
Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects.	3.5032935400671614
In Austria ' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least.	4.019525012292599
I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House.	3.960728803480599
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.	5.356144195571597
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.	5.1813313537883285
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history.	2.5249481459738123
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease.	4.588351768164949
Some Members have even come out against this.	3.325354093661782
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes.	3.8340595071591306
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States ' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	4.672069755074055
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	4.7978614422930566
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	4.321507032527731
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk.	4.281563266344856
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.	4.383462804805399
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	4.784089633655055
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	3.89144006767551
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Are we naively to grant 'freelance ' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?	3.4256335150878647
There is neither coherence nor human decency here.	3.17544296961395
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	4.799650866299293
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent.	6.9133504694549
. (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.	3.675754743188883
We have to get this right.	4.498356183206353
I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.	3.460427070330456
Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	4.063935067807334
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	2.367505394392421
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	3.1738847765000964
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry.	3.930098119845179
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	3.7834388308133233
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	4.0720724048334205
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	3.3578484423467625
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.	4.451287661176444
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	3.8020072879068807
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy ' s turn.	4.5635364878234705
Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying.	4.4050463530855355
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	4.0489261357931365
However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire.	4.8892148530152495
Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe ' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%?	3.738757374328543
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community ' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	4.129380344735658
However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission ' s staff is very low.	4.8492120090489745
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	6.21927057082005
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	4.540039690819744
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	3.1423166259776587
The second principle in the Council ' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.	4.452424144173767
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme.	3.8784389607991914
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground.	3.3530972065092275
So this issue will be addressed.	3.4583724164942313
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	3.463666969147614
Mr President, the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.	3.2717287611010724
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.	3.6623987347591105
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	4.114525484764413
(FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again.	3.23282248122838
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.	2.189111260038917
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	4.059721718666854
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council.	5.0626421632452425
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	3.993344291693744
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example.	5.549208357098482
Resumption of the session	1.0952419733067078
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of.	4.081372278059514
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	3.95069470469474
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.	3.292637016709583
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	4.076945060690857
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.	5.109275879218986
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	3.8635200907783314
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	3.788016226957789
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.	3.543640351611164
Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies.	3.0430315907821748
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests.	3.5199669973473124
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	3.2282244279163828
There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific.	4.643182943354475
The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	3.7828032326626935
Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges.	4.346738866243177
It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations.	4.037283994323025
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	3.9765913935656036
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	3.7047433974557857
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	5.253274523264138
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.	4.148952642005326
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	3.690863849736684
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention.	3.6599219609004026
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	3.4444197747470264
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field.	4.21646381621051
Have you already included your second term of office?	2.686745316455664
As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	3.7766510691287665
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations.	3.080615629697594
It is an excellent report.	3.8977234181765743
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.	4.544860478973245
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	3.8780309128782577
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	2.658065590922833
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	3.5767334603424734
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?	3.0927939644326847
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	4.104950932889957
Madam President, I am totally appalled by the Commission ' s, i.e. Mr Bolkestein ' s, political ignorance!	4.499049226899581
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.	5.016297800549655
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO ' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO ' s action.	4.024854261764389
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament ' s corresponding powers in this area.	3.9025173233699926
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	4.249825083740896
Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it.	3.850473105496144
There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe.	2.89248446564202
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one.	4.13310192430674
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself.	4.263579465742188
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.	4.5346383867572
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	4.5297206371567835
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.	2.6465641440639422
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	3.7380202690297115
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government?	3.4909516521366113
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.	6.12999964474093
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia, for that matter.	4.072001781369495
At my hearing last September, I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper.	2.943940143627208
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	2.8511624981847734
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.	3.1840891766582704
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	5.15508982521221
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.	3.794279066069101
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.	3.512252027498861
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	4.259773634817413
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.	3.2023624058632882
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	4.294257971103206
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.	3.361317366315897
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.	3.748117020586469
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	4.513385406311884
Report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Draft Framework Decision on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)	2.2646732545578137
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations.	4.342914441803173
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.	3.923222095281253
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	4.351626763539388
- (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to.	3.0160007168703418
And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations.	3.1453429286079104
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment.	3.9090503339880343
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market, only the body was being attacked. Now, it is the soul.	3.978770786106229
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	3.243399389788851
Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.	3.1255137332359793
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	3.4135791910634445
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community ' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.	3.7531627090184587
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	3.7942089224084192
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission ' s proposal more stringent.	6.527680911029112
As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State.	4.866082579794628
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles (8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD) (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	2.233446931833681
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	4.7254842272150634
Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union.	3.363986226919115
As regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism.	3.8223260510344126
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	5.013162955789194
We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation.	4.0334394304777
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent.	4.712056599530914
This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation. This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish.	4.166038173028861
The second point relates to Syria.	3.403691766265144
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	3.3217750562972856
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	3.451875858365263
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.	3.7157489104510866
The public must have a right to clean water.	5.420182799387854
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question.	4.484200625097272
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	2.8284733554746584
I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue.	3.7511372463165698
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	5.035225403268714
B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	3.2868366575833323
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	3.1764250951065174
We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local.	3.880407032839105
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	2.9056874294139
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve.	4.531727581673552
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	3.3971352431916992
Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives.	4.19179098826132
Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):	2.782948844335355
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	3.618638957344155
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer.	3.322646167999974
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	3.4410587989828176
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	2.4843770448475935
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one ' s office at European level.	3.8108542999863633
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints.	5.863600040999944
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.	3.9434370302912667
I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU.	4.527503038330572
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.	4.637773347272058
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	2.8068976298871915
We know that you have an important role in this.	4.296248706118743
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term.	3.923606420186514
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.	4.601737336979003
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union ' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	4.316946643423912
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning.	5.474721110714758
I am very fond of him.	4.145395806215867
I have good reason for asking this.	5.091806052484681
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	4.687078092865584
Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation ' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	3.810669053916443
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.	3.733412136167541
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	3.9024617027521553
Does that not say a lot about management ability?	3.9924638852571275
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	3.6226621307029054
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China.	3.947634852432061
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	4.197887575022338
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	4.661345719889817
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example.	4.574930254800345
Mr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday.	3.297329325817726
The partnership between the European Union and the ACP was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium.	4.987513018601959
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	3.8763886063896944
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships ' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace.	4.4095087666716655
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana.	3.713155935918217
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this.	4.211056371772706
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship ' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.	2.958471066784541
This time, however, it is true.	5.425640216291355
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years.	4.665425177509437
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.	5.3521324643951305
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
My position on this is clear.	4.716322339558511
As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets.	3.359847977292945
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.	4.458060204616019
A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.	3.7639272402279675
.	1.3940351656188106
Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really.	2.9726096097920993
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism.	3.6745248204892715
These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities.	3.858788465345594
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.	3.5606697391498696
Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission 's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality.	5.042886347975962
Many of the general points raised in our committee 's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan 's report.	3.055763467090634
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	3.960117625994643
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	4.78262053498005
More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs.	4.4546618939122435
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.	3.646461858036351
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	4.028756606695529
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	3.7170541471052854
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.	4.32902704532391
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.	3.8025856227940245
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament ' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open.	3.3422300113352095
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health.	3.2653928602038516
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	3.625911818029693
The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000.	3.4388105815702454
The term 'legale esterno ' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre ' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre ' is.	3.6871167074382227
In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."	4.106675998278995
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	3.8108633532960066
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.	4.485617646656682
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	3.035393813496936
But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold.	3.5850062062022614
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);	2.352713976988729
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	4.989710911669999
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	2.832363824559691
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	2.3507592251057168
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired.	3.447102442824788
In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted.	3.087528114849166
We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us.	3.8507118126611397
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	4.442303904542002
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	3.943911564516657
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	3.4441908731881297
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	3.780938234263894
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports.	3.65620583271735
We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires.	4.302761343200867
In order to do so, it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordinating body to implement a 'Women and Science ' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women ' s participation in research activities.	3.3876392849112746
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	2.5951617979989225
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries.	2.802162794197927
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.	7.030993699437939
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.	4.098485087871918
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	3.816258539652623
Corrie report (A5-0032/2000)	2.299417663163219
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	2.2601320148221093
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	4.771479769715615
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	3.6897864732952854
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now.	5.061961757742709
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.	3.7763788846133926
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.	4.218840910223988
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings.	4.156003154212516
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).	3.26237640352594
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	3.8040621993502417
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	3.6765577475279487
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"	2.821513118569008
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.	4.306222778490536
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China ' s Communist Party.	3.3615395486761614
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	3.4067070622732425
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals.	4.551783028910055
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	4.117102596641146
In three weeks ' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.	4.368575856039924
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel ' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	3.182459227073571
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance.	2.9972023004337607
This is not the way to fight extremism.	6.058997273465308
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	4.622166160231264
In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale.	3.589842347179962
Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government.	3.930807710496726
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.	4.201751605377472
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers.	4.293995689979747
However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern.	7.08029470036769
We are not doing a bad job of management.	3.9370515880968746
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	3.8960670756042055
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	3.970850324473384
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	3.6549968630047847
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations.	3.647995072176427
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.	5.358735838888001
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	5.405065476266836
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.	4.385572867527321
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.	3.1324525312748457
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	4.135585549953206
We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination.	4.3800021104313585
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?	2.891753407559356
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	4.247102021675248
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.	3.7710409443508413
This is unacceptable in my view.	2.9311288504368744
There was no majority for this at the time.	3.5369129932693144
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	5.50497327179943
Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	2.789895688205637
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament ' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.	4.252274684645163
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.	4.948635588904672
I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.	5.085231538169072
In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers ' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union.	3.732994356396691
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.	3.891546465640763
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.	4.379612665809816
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.	4.326431343196026
But Europe is changing.	5.063155239431985
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.	4.815817872047852
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.	4.157521001789218
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	3.8780640438510723
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	3.5463018753176327
The real culprits are Austria ' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	3.6779304134381774
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	4.390162047341083
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal ' .	2.756760043178897
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying.	4.7584403128321195
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	3.9433854768246595
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution.	3.746217532909751
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	4.1296185337777835
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	4.3129548936148945
At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.	4.2668523912665055
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development.	4.366472760998967
We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe?	3.7760713456077624
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	4.240615904859816
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.	3.8893516075622627
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.	3.860504181345722
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.	4.306633751864903
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025.	3.851306759699324
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	4.434945488847111
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.	4.87189961395648
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	4.620314936542637
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services.	3.707677093298623
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.	4.117933868053195
My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	3.284981845100676
In other words, a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous.	3.737527400247779
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements.	5.242521345158015
They see a beautiful planet, teeming with life, but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up.	2.731412743348378
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged.	4.769229167625614
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds.	4.56145605765316
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.	4.22475540529434
We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way.	4.248572274961535
- (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition.	3.729142037628679
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.	3.9379910386343946
It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life.	3.548802289011993
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	3.209914564347574
We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens.	4.90689494906024
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz.	2.3875546381064066
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions ' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission ' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission ' s relationship with the Council.	5.214032895804406
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	4.725498317641217
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	3.3768458179144165
Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming.	2.7329054027701503
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.	3.0133011979542768
But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances, and flexibility in negotiations, that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history.	4.268925897822441
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	3.655589218403776
It is better to do it absolutely properly.	4.419029646521641
Thank you for your reply.	1.877309301581086
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	3.866008962842759
Vote	2.601756410320264
Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order.	3.272719941255281
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	4.18358881033456
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste.	3.3011071144343327
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory.	3.830823518641216
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.	4.865350276634147
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.	4.629344517753291
The Commission ' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	3.8237263743435785
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	4.310276602494518
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.	3.113025777499443
I come from a rural area.	4.271866875088436
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament.	4.921204160363328
Everything has become more and more complex.	3.379227632920397
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	4.255448465062393
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	3.882523400329129
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.	4.073895813265633
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what ' but more 'what are we doing together ' ?	3.481134448245758
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.	4.73057583857457
I enthusiastically support the report 's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	3.3367547803011917
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	3.1221215024787465
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate.	4.272584590682336
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.	4.072359864905203
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	3.7262533492431182
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.	4.65456764653085
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.	4.594156981970564
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	4.362472536962857
If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.	4.253514395899153
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	3.5151016896469947
We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates.	5.411816215911542
"Condemns Mr Haider for his insults towards certain EU Member States and their leaders in the last few days in statements, which Foreign Minister Schüssel has failed to condemn."	3.350921560268165
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.	3.693763963599667
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.	4.30383107422534
Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee.	3.3321629192398476
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances.	3.926871088071513
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.	3.8770862985034524
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	3.977505599240394
However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change.	3.798966349013508
This has been talked about for years.	3.4984096173030617
Concerning Mr Evans ' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.	3.5305307754126196
As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected.	4.101669435841609
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.	3.18452192201751
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.	4.4860812207399805
- (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no.	3.15728803306847
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	3.798920152316771
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue.	3.6217818425633186
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter.	4.524182559806325
In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation.	3.729454402128975
That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus.	5.037287047467225
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	5.097354344523423
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians.	4.392993838851
I should like to mention a few specific points.	3.307649071310674
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.	4.446149486092536
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject.	3.8474477799640003
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.	4.6619330556496745
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so.	4.172881861550963
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.	6.929855063715708
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.	3.836213989707776
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	4.0586489662690015
On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed.	5.2093778011621215
I hope for their adoption.	5.666691864915747
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies.	4.465279850691545
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	4.31593783697622
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission.	3.0985260640453998
It would be Europe ' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.	4.28597631617581
A man with three children and he was murdered.	3.8682482833587484
So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease.	4.543077059971527
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	3.2251857654147464
In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.	3.187228276561897
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.	4.002729623969753
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man ' s activities.	3.4082853905178343
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.	4.162693746184495
The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion.	4.48099613225554
We must be very vigilant.	5.138501358220948
Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	3.1869029383391196
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.	3.2457496589219383
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.	4.177739282140649
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.	3.9583136863551758
It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly.	4.600804265441669
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano ' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament.	3.863062350903028
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country ' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	4.538445668426098
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	3.688095378577376
Many thanks for this.	3.135892675095742
Apparently, according to my information, the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work.	2.7316817280545362
The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.	4.147906720107137
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	5.707067796100921
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council.	3.9791148560063307
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	4.442902084423864
Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs.	3.1071203468858397
Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge.	4.027162599472403
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.	3.7629278130542176
You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	4.302554327999354
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.	3.502778353010249
I saw some of Mr Kinnock 's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	3.98541913762031
As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China.	3.9379906727925813
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	3.7512393975251848
Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring ' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse.	3.2870787137534
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis.	5.68675120178897
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	3.1717618598481585
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied.	3.7647577732080553
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.	3.2945341043885557
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	4.024263684917166
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks.	4.035164173649929
Thank you very much Commissioner.	2.6992336277251554
Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money.	2.908665108624684
The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.	4.931104410733735
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	4.258296938996971
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.	3.4824419703504175
I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.	3.5701022733418437
This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income, with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies.	3.584551449450652
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?	2.8998194566960076
The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.	3.7706814066126415
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently.	3.91607310649419
Urgent change is required today.	2.235135735341422
As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton ' s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead.	3.2507962981139267
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.	3.4610935293235756
Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs.	4.352954083791921
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	3.8251808635773923
We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier.	3.383696067264345
Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents.	3.8639166867179355
As I have already said on a number of occasions, I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect, on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process, the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law, rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator.	4.445728233481603
We are extremely disappointed.	5.348437872589714
For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.	4.782657780161419
The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty.	5.559821031799489
Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail.	4.967315988123811
It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail.	3.5240037673877325
We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament.	3.373542691056073
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).	4.121169975782142
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission ' s proposal.	3.447822296096785
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent.	3.46747592442607
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	4.827458587685199
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	4.364112883303719
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	3.4909417089537325
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion.	4.305746601992084
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.	4.485617855960303
So, unification in this small area.	3.439831807607315
Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of "centre of the debtor ' s main interests" .	3.3982587473814228
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.	3.4344125450960528
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	3.721250420742034
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today ' s decision makers.	4.730033348207546
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.	3.663907428513032
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain ' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.	2.860266368279134
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	4.078713529811294
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn.	4.400867508315025
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.	5.2671104407843465
I know that action is being taken against this so-called tourism elsewhere, but we must remember the European Union ' s responsibility at this level.	4.941374263306368
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice.	5.95269245828409
These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe.	4.185641362767971
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	3.5462679124141796
Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives.	2.9267692025265917
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	2.7487390334876474
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	4.141331430808819
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.	3.121241010581796
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.	4.293368252247163
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	3.6704282186463937
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	3.1639973168805913
- (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ.	4.384641286036786
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	3.4076308889441833
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures.	3.381605582275204
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	3.8127915683938007
They want to see results.	4.321124227615225
This has not just happened.	5.5884434305747135
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)	2.1183567341281364
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.	5.078913719351885
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	3.7708371183211926
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)	2.2822215880031402
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose.	4.051179610983483
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	3.8550034854695223
We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope.	3.261058808866792
Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists.	3.321657195505637
Cyprus should be one sovereign state, with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised.	2.9304257064855355
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	4.575893197573751
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	2.863877071364256
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.	3.953890731874187
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making.	3.5525196808279893
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	3.949866982806087
The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be.	4.087356066276678
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?	3.1770529348750642
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.	3.159433291745477
To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us.	3.732194765703553
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.	4.036180752797285
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	3.9802661341314836
In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.	3.934134305406314
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on.	3.5002042368448607
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.	4.5623998937079095
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle.	4.183551904626674

The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.	3.6806715491832858
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community.	4.852308746687412
Mr President, I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs ' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece.	4.065707951372401
I would ask for that to be checked again.	4.616678437472837
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	3.745339360629647
What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government.	3.6359203260656083
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	3.8520432029616574
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	4.852965755190141
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	4.219347972592824
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.	6.291627683799559
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition.	4.295405439338654
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	4.070179475409471
What could be the cause of this?	4.184987222548716
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	4.091105940017017
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well.	3.0869711841849097
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	4.323469894243071
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	3.474515910991804
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations.	3.3818051850027
Over the next seven years, the Commission ' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	4.300093658815646
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.	4.112066467941497
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length.	3.3676817720925976
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating.	3.813557663250458
In the Commission guidelines, few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA. The amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented.	3.6892897871108348
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.	3.8699032625373855
In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed.	3.6164883451219656
However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership ' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance.	3.3738929257075574
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	3.881523468398761
Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.	2.423530457852361
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	4.295380874142767
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	3.869519460002567
There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high.	3.781935733494403
Mr President, I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level.	3.939153340109709
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union ' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana ' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?	3.61047467581137
Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain.	4.453713955786258
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	4.065675786761007
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	3.2596247132956386
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.	3.6880585870848503
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.	3.5960899814811405
I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.	5.300355730299963
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	3.804741616665532
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)	1.9580841815323522
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?	4.32916916727558
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.	4.800781325710571
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel.	2.7582600830382766
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	4.411285108432478
They see us killing each other.	2.8938718239541386
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.	3.0907129421122628
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.	2.749281207927935
(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)	2.001174065505006
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	3.298803891594739
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.	4.144237387191434
This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999.	5.4885091637176435
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	5.332095814895002
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.	3.9735024511850163
As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases.	4.399083173573552
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States ' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.	4.4404421477609475
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	3.782733963977176
Mr President, Mr Katiforis ' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report.	3.4345927243500554
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.	4.647087995395788
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	3.750056640930053
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.	3.371478849954981
But that does not take away from the fact that the report ' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	5.604540006123864
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising.	3.4592964820893872
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	4.721317057417539
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name.	4.105491162723267
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	3.8524375095214562
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: "Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such" .	4.2863263347370335
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	3.7549637480489393
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards.	4.6348741554081165
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.	3.7495930115984564
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	4.0715277666272724
What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used.	4.580552223989426
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	5.311661271185987
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.	4.034854581608492
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope.	3.828716364156006
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990.	3.536674241645838
I believe that today ' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors.	5.348144854193752
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison.	4.762271330098929
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal.	4.541209579767626
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament ' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.8067509690693977
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):	2.533281977737114
Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life.	2.9756971972705135
First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive.	3.431146674542363
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.	3.2181409479188994
The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament ' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date.	3.4280257822994122
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion.	3.6249781554387948
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.	5.665263170216343
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb.	4.545363992770742
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur.	3.6052650821628927
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.	3.7537916694195035
That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.	3.7868851486840573
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.	4.616990024335438
In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens.	4.434436607286708
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.	3.126824922032447
The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud.	4.586869402128115
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission ' s report.	4.878388814141651
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	4.4509610444444485
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	3.8987803992100574
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.	4.957396708421069
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction.	3.471522918642352
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	3.45787971455289
This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment. However, this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments.	4.154734890414612
Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation.	3.773502108494085
I have evidence that this is possible.	6.772006468141588
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	3.953889470766089
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	2.9295886662465556
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	2.93818412061723
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	3.9129239563900513
Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them, after I have had them translated? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication, which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy, and what is propaganda.	4.5341541025148295
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	4.6887915881868185
If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again.	3.6869476902293257
This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. We now hope to be able to solve these problems.	4.636719054126678
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	4.1044842191440205
A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture.	3.9209430116203103
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong.	3.1223388787561195
It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms.	3.2669404916364275
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	4.493118914463918
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.	2.6678869494579915
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, under Directive 70/524, high-technology additives are treated differently, depending on the date of authorisation.	3.2857053884716807
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	3.618221864798282
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.	3.7032744663282164
Where is the beef?	1.6603375509415645
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	4.633075054191774
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.	5.208192119646555
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	4.311805482128359
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	3.8587478218290494
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence.	4.33181754151107
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	5.465906992626916
We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy.	4.93254938992358
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers.	3.4067655425214016
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements.	2.629182486464945
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.	4.881950725361734
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	4.299442608604574
When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth.	3.577618159908906
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	3.7707260494327075
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	3.583135355842717
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:	5.12196753164351
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10.	2.4311292270507603
The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO. This was intended to be proactive and, using a regional approach, to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population.	3.5114223672000127
We must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions, and I quote, that "If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council ' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition" .	3.7781562511274074
I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed, because you need to hope in order to be disappointed. and I have had no hope since the investiture debate.	5.340657399032589
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it.	4.505701358772477
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.	3.7032013719807657
He is not always right, but in this case he is.	4.326463700309423
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities.	3.900099622611738
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice.	3.220585761732586
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	3.1485838667350396
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	3.8700857443645447
In more direct terms, to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams, this would contravene the Treaty of Rome.	3.464548128209398
In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments.	3.2087991678945484
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	3.3004546466841473
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	3.326294216459398
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU ' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	3.546835532929029
In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate.	4.765531519214677
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	4.3542746149109215
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.	2.9226616892667034
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71.	3.3866234414387484
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	3.452740123216818
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward.	4.195905589136832
The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater.	3.3910719861398833
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	4.570419802716127
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives.	4.87778987585206
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context.	3.435530170672203
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular.	4.531154586970163
I can gauge its importance for my country ' s international reputation.	4.463802554055708
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	4.625517408340802
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission ' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.	3.573639700605805
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality: water will be the main resource at stake in years to come, starting tomorrow.	3.5668381771300566
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health.	4.167549359745918
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	4.221363559045068
I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers.	3.6883427743031336
Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand.	3.8334513238216905
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration.	3.6848697987988985
That is the reality.	3.6000019941925427
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration.	4.1461040902577775
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.	8.424648987110727
So how far have we come?	4.032720255538308
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	2.552094854127859
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	3.462045769219646
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.	4.536046601869415
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	3.3859435726085807
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.	3.461823872154232
In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.	3.8741271843537364
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.	4.0974856739707
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	3.596540600287054
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data.	5.1742863034448865
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man ' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	4.350721287917486
My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support.	3.3901170109056875
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.	4.875109212674316
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon.	4.967246783841205
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.	4.990906174175065
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.	3.004422079423964
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from, among others, scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully.	3.7378349409355835
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	2.7847765017740747
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament ' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.5266443453738265
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean.	3.9004433540274985
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola.	4.502077162009819
From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs.	3.5619544404239507
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	5.0161295433057385
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.8143819275036557
One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny.	4.16049520399327
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support.	3.794302662943497
These were essentially of three types which I will describe.	4.196259662055406
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland.	3.6786651336508385
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	4.154907089047708
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria.	3.048145963828209
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	3.8120929199745115
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	3.035622042116557
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004.	2.9312948360482602
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.	5.991403119590754
It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%.	4.23222976666969
An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries.	3.9667580610899247
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	4.198599531369385
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	4.956783142351175
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense.	4.564188014376707
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.	4.034032208933773
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	4.927213234744239
I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion.	3.6121360004522414
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.	3.18037429024974
For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance.	5.4380150903350755
There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved.	3.414172596765852
This is what the Commission will be judged on.	5.910658058839192
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	4.1630969438885685
That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used.	4.335540941482669
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta?	2.877385314059194
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.	3.4553742610345766
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	4.048837685406818
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans.	4.385912362103235
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	3.9691736608480777
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe ' s common heritage.	4.498526850269236
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	4.242149280497647
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser ' s or a fitness centre.	4.090066011190037
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively ' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	3.110703065057251
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	3.9943595243705388
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	3.809673124042878
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive.	5.046937362319802
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	3.829895173537751
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.	3.2555567637163607
Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence.	5.313212764451948
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent.	3.792959791511862
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	3.4540498483504383
You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people.	3.3837534544476404
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	3.374147779448597
What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	3.135992986350856
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	3.6174089325204726
Oil slick off the French coast	2.5637965605368294
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	2.688633642296275
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003.	4.012046243612429
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.	4.265013935805513
We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace.	4.584319954655566
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.	3.711179513190735
But I should like to stress the fact that, on this issue of the environment, the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal.	5.481925322845879
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.	4.561656815936949
Ladies and gentlemen, we must challenge the monopoly the world ' s speculative elite have on planning the world ' s economy by remaining outside the tax system.	3.0241942484721123
Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time.	3.01703824754452
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission ' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners.	4.427288045634679
Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved.	2.6957436282064835
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.	3.315668958561206
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	4.127247564994428
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements.	3.8816860877911945
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).	4.76193891233082
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	3.6105827222582563
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case.	3.8415496778046934
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	4.234628568384317
Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique.	3.1173017097715032
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.	4.988405346686878
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament ' s original position on the issue of comitology.	5.256431080512773
There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment.	2.9399441052987596
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there.	4.156375278615047
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.	4.471940453174709
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	4.5305027254680805
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.	4.390574600718008
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0136/2000) by Mr Queiro, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Berthu, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	2.951829053369448
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	3.685632486673218
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.	3.739544777118002
The fourth group is legal certainty.	4.667325635341434
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	4.0052244765045515
We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence.	3.553305155293712
Indeed, it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international, public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by.	3.127556593142162
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	3.7563003420160253
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas.	4.37463892468846
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	5.387467584238046
It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency.	4.177740039572379
I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect.	5.081382446701714
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.	4.607905007464213
But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem.	5.033924477552414
Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.	3.321306053125069
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.	4.224769502950743
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	2.977081906363165
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.	3.8919240164323803
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	3.4336204660430267
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable.	2.8258122550936475
- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.	3.501735073487717
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that.	3.713167791203728
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.	4.5321115978413475
Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical.	3.684474283330723
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	3.7333754050061843
. (PT) Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate.	4.114075228702146
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	3.373613206892942
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	5.755033260242686
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	3.8961480196508647
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?	4.581024623103959
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	4.33899060138322
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question.	3.9782711724255404
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.	4.818451954816692
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand.	4.2039791389084
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	4.411688575335408
That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve.	3.5851724147917627
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	4.966414433909379
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.	3.955397428299592
We have serious reservations about the Council ' s proposed amendments.	5.220859432657505
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	2.9373522454351946
My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me.	3.4329221942148562
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.	3.63090286212164
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains.	4.27778235674317
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.	3.0146359975589845
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year 's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs.	3.4936641019273735
But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets.	5.145905844631542
Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)	2.521246553117733
Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries?	4.349081259143727
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.	3.9278865803228116
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words.	3.6719821332013534
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance.	3.730525539268013
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	3.8113153348303768
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning.	3.8320731563693684
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.	4.499856828618043
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.	5.768292079988339
Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.	2.9532904417924115
Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency.	4.684574816499852
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.	3.9911038514050765
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal ' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.	3.167727958781586
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	4.301507699440425
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.	3.2086462852601505
Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions.	2.5730251837596056
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	6.318693138425465
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	4.164444326428892
I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity.	3.9093559120584254
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.	3.1941457987852138
At the Commission 's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded.	3.7663383557777195
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	4.469283012595638
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy.	5.442484964648776
Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it.	4.080427806923047
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.	4.273302691644919
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	3.7791639683067695
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	4.067359517039502
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6283050878427754
This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well.	2.986449755144681
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	3.072789707365161
Because they have a different level of education.	3.233827499402591
The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	4.904268268650135
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?	4.588223261264591
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures, in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities.	4.452355374760243
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	3.609873262023495
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world.	2.621015554495469
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe ' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.	4.417850909275204
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	4.329512178624067
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	4.818134535110776
Its argument was one of priority.	3.443957013976209
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted.	4.704420391731313
Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	3.1123610189119
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others.	2.217202470497726
Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many.	2.7073137545625836
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.	4.067496398972833
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.	3.4918595072824576
Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups.	3.594914919609225
It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments.	3.6054653711732945
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme.	5.374895996926093
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe.	3.2194482486824882
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.	5.363668733517682
Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus.	4.597810780275714
Finally, the issue of officials.	6.252236717297066
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.	3.185792135169022
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	5.673219243811438
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.	5.576057125893385
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves.	4.759119129126044
Lastly, I believe - and this is also the presidency ' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations, given the skilful, intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General, and the UN organisation in general, have conducted these discussions, and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties ' positions.	4.4152758271184585
This has since been unanimously approved.	4.775905813469068
Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.	3.4817475754388103
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	3.8587871134814065
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	2.922960797037706
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	3.5888963105073644
The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.	4.362171824228156
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.	4.0507205389126195
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	4.425426448731254
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance ' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	3.025434309945197
Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions.	3.7012286922810147
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	3.4050031944934687
So that is at least a step forward.	3.3970316509759533
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.	3.2453001837046154
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves.	4.353569126347416
The EU ' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors, on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament ' s analysis.	5.0357981582242575
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	3.5661443815597744
In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water.	3.51741480954022
In view of all this, I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism.	5.282008510196637
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability.	2.5824546852427956
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	3.7966335988125146
In Europe today, the tourism market contributes 5.5% of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce, approximately 6%.	3.4509304714887055
I think ours is a different approach!	5.023368526053384
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same.	4.001680570358875
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	4.299460827521311
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.	4.267891155237444
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council.	3.3067190447791917
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	4.81516336653199
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.	3.4257102581621712
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty.	3.4610034389430955
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	3.192502673719583
However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past.	3.6840775902803617
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	3.4521419092953587
It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.	4.763681850529268
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	5.599322179877208
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.	3.3580043747262653
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.	2.5586603830776635
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union.	3.560770575106674
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	3.6810262647029464
But the Member States failed to cooperate.	4.843169306121563
If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive.	3.844589173314763
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	3.579581989508865
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	4.210182082622108
The previous speaker already said something about this.	4.663581851384617
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	3.860276397473348
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.	4.057036257356738
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	3.633880787762563
I know I can rely on everyone here.	4.523893090636237
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service ' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.	3.559998798002694
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.	4.644255118977035
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.557546404786129
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	4.031903477452539
We therefore welcome the Commission ' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.	3.828162721010959
. (EL) The EU ' s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in the form of a joint agreement as established by Article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that Balkan republic.	3.9044534628573038
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.	3.8367988602766316
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	7.803301338481336
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	3.270935087380403
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	4.875803649677049
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.	4.839130461107483
That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts.	3.3279718467259274
.	1.3940351656188106
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	3.2246067956313427
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives.	2.9005923861653233
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.	4.733821681753803
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.	4.3681318920091465
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	4.172636329192662
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	4.197004166576799
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your valuable contribution to this Question Time.	2.558200253803186
It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission ' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions.	5.363967223160695
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	4.98344800860595
And indeed there is a twofold shift.	6.608617168316548
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks.	4.585695225125146
Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law.	4.056787787923473
They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc.	3.468215190102586
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar.	3.464001485112227
It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission ' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way.	4.080806299599041
We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission.	4.618737140962644
In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union ' s role in terms of copyright.	4.908179080081252
As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position.	3.992264110095725
To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union ' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted.	3.3778636115603367
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	2.928810966655052
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	3.750884065629914
I shall take the floor very briefly, Madam President.	4.548726245920448
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved.	5.480301239384015
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.	3.8609368725720667
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	3.5974112652341477
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria.	2.5259669255880084
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.	3.35553538067085
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses.	4.389807984552026
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.	4.17526288220382
Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured.	3.1049387634165546
The matter of the European Union ' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.	4.975567537648942
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	2.7598907755613067
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.	4.450250127448244
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for.	3.7832784701046824
Mrs Stenzel ' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	3.5595670277566454
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.	4.2695099750618075
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life.	3.6378299538589385
In a sense this is where its work begins.	4.685511554479126
A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country ' s fishing industry.	4.274515348105178
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.	3.6056128358745445
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed.	4.69312371629273
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water.	3.569639599256991
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	3.6139538666273285
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States ' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	4.616991584279849
With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct.	4.335760710886357
A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short.	3.8047012236923843
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.	2.946460055500319
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.	4.142188303182804
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission ' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	4.658812040748163
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU ' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed.	4.336669405321963
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	1.9382595463743773
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	3.360680018693891
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc.	3.9829961018474926
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)	2.2024542274525865
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	4.2259311974776415
We will be organising and supporting actions including, in particular, the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.	4.22030704784639
The stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various Member States, despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit.	5.311330636629679
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service.	4.535724657191058
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate.	4.319466986588947
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday.	3.2869745288573964
Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided.	4.417983321510316
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	4.086292544016403
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3811274786686611
Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective.	3.8059116913699076
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors ' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	3.598146495431212
So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor ' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented?	3.4609762408331823
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	4.535141353930637
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate.	3.6808426609817526
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244.	3.7714475911698857
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.	3.499084278479607
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States.	4.155433304631561
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	3.391654575798595
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45.	3.3008676257125478
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.	3.956531405104361
But the figures tell the true story.	3.836679394587821
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.	4.22352570322713
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	3.9988802200003373
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	4.4726857219419145
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.	3.777454717313177
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution.	4.1098753893720925
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	4.161796426126486
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.	4.8736404970719995
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	3.9353625971695525
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.	3.6712197747113566
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.	3.231834061516518
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations.	4.249775521360458
The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800.	4.0596214975777665
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements.	3.9041580521653234
One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion.	4.8091338351052055
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	4.5774340927148955
Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.	2.7042621640904594
Report (A5-0012/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established within the Community (COM(99)0003 - C5-0050/2000 - 1999/0013(CNS)	2.210518035981305
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	5.385127473662856
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	3.6229402566040454
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise.	3.2588386706220533
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.	3.218671957242503
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.	3.4272596682220273
Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading.	4.479248537151534
The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission ' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances.	4.227325274236618
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	5.833324557711272
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country.	4.354253336467567
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age.	5.131706109216709
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	2.6905689660540286
They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult.	4.044413546397172
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda.	4.94602041301299
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	5.672355112559757
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	4.39915544467796
With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.	4.239382453759392
.	1.3940351656188106
We disagree with many of the report ' s views.	5.778638173000524
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	3.2852914869457
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission ' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	4.646877650561337
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if . safe for human health and the environment" .	3.8870303789790173
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	4.845813915258952
	1.0363974359942942
We must strike a balance between them.	4.4710070345303095
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative.	5.456160793439032
I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	3.3650141891568492
The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	3.593569957166548
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	3.801329627864229
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.8840611680037562
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.	3.31351703805488
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	3.885591940440477
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	3.1845230511572495
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective.	4.484761688717982
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.	4.9601547369867065
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue.	4.84832121926851
We need to do something about it.	5.050283356095526
I understand what you are saying.	6.765276841056148
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	4.213941433543922
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	3.4326348124820423
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	4.337365308280502
However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint.	4.014088533321722
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities.	3.4271816323704845
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties.	3.923811044445427
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	4.257872699045729
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	4.513740222379835
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary.	3.339176909972815
Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds.	4.463108180808935
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	3.8451148857748785
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment.	3.859950738562195
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me.	3.719748781140482
Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen ' so often.	2.870616010075627
Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?	5.772680533714229
We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency ' s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme.	5.43851925140351
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996.	2.470256508922027
In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	3.9412628125812064
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.	2.870144792755879
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.	4.430503051200345
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation.	3.125385491263996
However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.	4.297863163347839
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas, hops, cows and Indian hemp.	3.346969513917575
I am convinced that the Bible, God ' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values.	3.6235937764110577
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission ' s White Paper.	5.173097041516054
This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU.	6.198990159650767
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	5.712314651199171
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.	2.834440059777834
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth.	4.417630355392236
Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.	5.973713069118934
However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals.	4.822780267862051
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	4.580665093998646
It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage.	4.674034533306941
By then, my children will be older than I am now.	3.2302686074956544
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it.	5.878512886150893
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if the world is turned upside down.	3.218563199069313
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	3.947558421680639
Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow.	3.5048614729131655
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	4.178228190351229
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	4.407286041798527
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.	3.0299551473634736
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.	4.275146023417011
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or, in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around, the manufacturer, has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with ecology; it is a simple question of competition!	4.146589112638088
For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.	4.117313998700769
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries.	4.0934651258558175
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes.	4.005109601989698
Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all.	3.5510819312487767
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats ' request to hold the vote on Friday.	4.806537708486706
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars.	3.9850951478851018
Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems.	3.3620985420611627
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.	3.218941753834007
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted.	5.824721823023409
Mr Swoboda ' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level.	3.388698863736209
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	3.3528096246414085
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	3.430481381459539
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	4.527505142492236
The second sentence should read: '., weshalb diese Hilfen ' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und ' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen ' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).	3.06893061726729
With what aim?	4.761098295755421
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	5.081589103018831
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.	4.068392329906833
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.	4.244117036992296
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	3.6363020103025434
But this new course of action is very exciting.	4.058809219920699
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	5.349667687200069
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.	4.111092107304125
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	5.330059435357535
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.	3.3790325074133793
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.	4.268709730127088
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.	4.6483578445208185
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	3.9249912173567627
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be.	3.103051874305383
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course.	3.1422295084076723
It is fine, in principle.	3.636267215283675
The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will, on the contrary, be supporting a number of amendments, especially those tabled by the Greens.	5.590360634766587
So there is a whole raft of contradictions.	4.321313390681594
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security.	3.283112255495761
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	3.999717410771941
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	3.6015478031458894
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	4.770714306601712
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures.	3.7424701622859367
I just want to emphasise this further.	4.3800037159682335
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.	4.244298546166961
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform.	4.253027980514782
I cannot accept this.	4.159700104049164
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.	4.855915734751009
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.	3.515875037595231
The widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established, is, of course, only a kill or cure remedy, an ultimum remedium, which, in the case of Austria, can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective, and by way of warning.	3.848312162236313
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them.	2.5069457218730298
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions.	3.778363041393549
However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado ' has disappeared completely.	2.9762670701159357
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned.	5.280349795411214
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.	3.577345157874503
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	4.155085054299135
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	3.157451483175445
Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment.	4.418275579328169
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for .	4.316520879967601
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.	4.485665672641815
It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution.	4.793368964164932
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	4.273255270839262
Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state.	3.276992980105458
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	2.856070579703128
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed.	5.395486451210311
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile.	7.173866508685764
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament.	4.949836873845766
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.	4.948558275108381
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	3.6293329924251507
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.	4.367084583897774
We understand the context of this essential debate.	6.30996103353289
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.	3.7462729715790983
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.	2.308521935176751
What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment.	4.09618672976943
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.	4.176640083523817
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	3.6622474746613847
What are we actually doing then?	3.0195940578677307
Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking.	4.375683672414749
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	4.234712707851889
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	4.147732547954826
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	3.5856640290369532
Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.	3.4488910945261257
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe ' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.	5.050920702338992
(Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays.	3.4652107863583455
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.	4.327235119537635
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	2.9388473151995504
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	4.219554360915038
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House ' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique. I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available.	4.471379847202969
We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity, but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world. This means that its resources for coping with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non-existent.	4.0583757516530055
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.	3.963977630396085
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.	4.432864933788434
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	2.4865610856467018
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	4.225435105237479
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%.	4.441731086349526
In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate.	4.2748561617315755
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today.	3.8143111659913194
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.	4.709909104162144
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.	3.721917908789147
It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well.	3.894514993086015
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	3.9324181965253957
Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances.	3.92164557322785
From the Commission ' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni.	5.010868557288821
I would welcome more concrete information on this.	4.559588822353185
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	3.5450821756070123
Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme.	3.7919679642265947
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.	2.416894816686971
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.	4.88170373196336
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer, more just and more secure.	4.685666566817359
You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.	3.361523435285839
Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):	2.4495686334389517
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.	4.88174223409566
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	5.3042986479762995
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	3.796204504899013
Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people 's thoughts.	2.9956705967905375
It was erroneously included in today ' s agenda.	3.9649321889284908
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects.	4.323137328800055
Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe ' s water policy for the next three decades.	3.8146410929262036
Relating to Amendment No 31	2.6554099250634517
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):	2.5020672571040974
Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set.	3.6835140658378833
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.	4.287457952342835
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	3.885847327568943
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	3.7544847417996987
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	3.4312033467792755
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race.	4.627572890015863
However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries.	3.858354440786564
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	3.7507039533731295
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.	3.807328949679157
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	4.750129789154512
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.	3.0656096251328226
Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around.	3.5356640340777847
Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message.	3.92204497154449
Mr Bösch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them.	4.460521413183944
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive.	4.471094263618024
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remains, however, one immediate problem: the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted, many of whose lives are in danger, in their flooded villages, hoping that they will be rescued.	3.6022043560084005
I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.	3.0971058845123993
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	3.727843261056577
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch ' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.	3.6278620625306286
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	3.274397371668651
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities.	5.651127251713387
There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that.	4.2448887183936606
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.	3.824209205165976
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	4.422795290665782
That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions.	5.353812516640705
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful.	4.660609714699697
I would like to present the Commission ' s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament.	4.151681673589015
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	3.1711963536222765
(DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect.	3.782333660870509
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.6346602911311297
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.	4.164563055703349
Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction.	3.137599276236949
That concludes the vote.	2.911157386759644
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.	4.386716604980531
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	4.872502266697996
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.	4.753971359491968
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	3.9917699568197818
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people ' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission ' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	4.155108150521864
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	3.341838521647382
It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years.	3.493916087800411
But the source is threatening to run dry.	3.9357932870751484
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work.	4.2002874465941336
Thirdly: it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails.	5.661609958268414
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.	5.5904248894952815
If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.	3.57928497444138
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	3.5023192864677344
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term.	4.589631838620913
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently.	4.01030957044695
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes.	4.528704153289108
I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State.	3.6710074838926467
I completely understand your concerns, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue.	4.4935841470903375
and	2.13800651508283
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	2.7928845237713302
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	2.736105689153687
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.	4.053162994301062
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.	6.394882598327022
Can you tell us your position on this subject?	3.9790842923654535
Did anyone find work?	2.183084468101932
Mr President, Mr Alavanos ' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues.	3.2903715639526205
There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider ' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European.	3.7301646484860718
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make.	4.870827912474438
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet?	3.7479490562163416
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	4.232766798773802
To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle.	4.000348991411364
Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight.	4.019532448935267
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	3.545170732163247
I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today ' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment.	3.685764639933095
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts.	4.519285168562292
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government ' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	2.951525016078575
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	3.8324393059147748
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.	4.630687979932516
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	2.8769895173755673
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.	4.371688920555146
Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process.	4.200497268131751
By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution.	4.05934022915282
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation ' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague ' (p.18).	3.558893742413293
I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life.	3.351624328525138
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.	4.362549902648459
We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana.	4.956074476380386
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur ' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.	4.085025537309817
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.	4.229869052528968
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted.	2.6139216695484593
However, the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar, and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions, priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice.	3.729691699218117
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	4.08873551311114
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	2.3902876678971365
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly.	4.329023866134223
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	4.0370617656346885
That did not happen.	5.11246197539261
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	4.197170334337419
Nevertheless, I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity.	3.8389502187023385
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.	4.458907489497029
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	5.142983725507183
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision.	4.34739162661314
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.	3.752921809988019
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament ' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU.	3.5251832531117233
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	4.564829411728116
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	3.2550974917052895
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.	4.54429296934506
So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet.	3.3630903378024475
It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union.	3.990608397868608
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?	3.027781807963623
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor.	2.8964218468421605
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	5.335264946808348
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office ' s business abroad?	4.733103813993207
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.	3.1145444094053834
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament ' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant.	4.397414990099872
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission ' s way of working.	3.957516057930994
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!	5.042038295110835
Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union ' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole.	4.214505457786983
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium.	2.845140674404503
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	4.188836484245661
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds.	5.095149579513413
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	4.554686535779574
From here on things are going to be easier.	5.0975751253861485
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.	4.453252819572206
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.	3.7404121547348756
I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	5.006722179438986
I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	4.60584208792994
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.	5.245573344979204
Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property.	3.5295597963189644
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is.	4.882548225789288
The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity.	4.417554079504874
Protection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interests	3.2574775931521405
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed.	4.59840258028554
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner.	4.529044063070018
I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions.	4.936820946420363
In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water.	4.20732959628277
By way of clarification: if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget.	3.1182883437718263
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.	5.411026487346851
Madam President, the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one.	4.966497976755271
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.	3.3070785212710816
My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women.	3.8048090347213943
He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve.	3.319620859503095
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.	4.094801602564158
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC.	4.389904082027893
A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable.	3.869400858792836
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.	3.672015941260311
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission 's reform proposals.	4.750881788546215
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.	5.541400698340597
It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate.	3.7439308382617655
Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.	4.779196147182641
We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers.	4.009361614291064
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons.	3.9446037674773127
Thank you for your reply.	1.877309301581086
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.081684619817497
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised?	3.0984732294407076
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	2.4865610856467018
Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector ' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively	2.797376382812054
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens ' indifference to Europe.	3.514558651017925
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	4.521631118114784
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.	5.473840418391573
As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources.	3.583079969100603
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.	3.2636071880562687
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered?	3.1661467309234146
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.	3.4793055830718496
Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known.	3.6945636207820005
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible.	4.149958865936833
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.	4.638261157673273
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	2.8060303997552185
Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together.	4.069833013658077
In view of the humanitarian aid being given by the European Union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration, Mr Bernard Kouchner, what measures will the Council take to defend the rights of the women of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women, women in confinement and new-born children?	3.681756776460379
On a separate matter altogether, I would like to support Cuba ' s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.	4.245704292147058
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.	4.193776679950233
First of all: who should pay?	2.6274727788145023
The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations.	4.721238641170527
So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.	3.1273835758689708
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	3.477437134170017
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge.	4.014268978630636
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	3.69530135524202
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union ' s Member States.	5.36294875692297
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.	3.7438818815683845
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	3.9239456318118773
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.	3.1505362976656692
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	2.572008801249572
In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions.	3.8027952340827693
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	3.9895335910082648
So it also has to do with environmental protection.	4.269612705771916
.	1.3940351656188106
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	2.8386060822395702
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.	4.080091111922685
And no one can comprehend this attitude.	3.8568147257320673
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	3.2209192922834116
To continue would be economic suicide.	3.8556086820256446
The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN ' s Security Council.	4.227341192793044
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units.	4.0075213465549275
So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive.	3.296563827803525
There is now a new Commission.	3.2682055979230413
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level.	3.4919807046914926
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	4.046596794685264
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	3.3143993988823506
Indeed that was the idea behind it.	3.1631402846690264
It is still the old imperial service.	4.925678455445011
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.	4.675269394808029
This is something we have borne in mind.	4.410600604300031
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has.	6.260966384391245
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems.	4.463432148594533
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.	3.730704860284765
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.	3.9192352296411275
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.	3.917949190417226
Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.	4.275562863256593
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.	4.062879125535906
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured.	3.3621088048464927
This is also reflected in many of Parliament ' s amendments.	5.487818279368414
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence.	3.5562528730557665
I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy.	4.253773239341362
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	3.765175415414468
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	4.357907130941079
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years ' time.	4.580618730860927
Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.	3.5718709418012042
For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level.	4.364852785257779
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.	4.963899380253739
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow, not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but, more seriously, for humanity as a whole.	3.6792739740766764
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.	3.6636535535109673
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report.	4.078493522898744
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	3.406196605988365
Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)	2.1075834421342163
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	2.7235419238669967
On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	3.701264695450528
This is why it has been around for years, and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response.	4.996118708740904
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	4.839690189182681
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	4.262322055042746
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?	3.5937754209714137
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	3.169525088903406
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown.	4.904588247895869
Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing.	3.136231187664454
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report.	5.879269408481156
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses.	2.3164669908798428
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	3.3271340018023876
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	3.7710898775718924
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	4.994232786023593
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward.	3.566753802222183
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.	5.619540953996959
We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.	3.9939184925949744
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
- (IT) On behalf of the Italian Communists, I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document, which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for Europe up until the year 2005.	4.358313795683215
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	4.45683680691639
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.8463718256629875
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved.	3.953250573802239
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	3.527529656512132
This is reasonable and we support this, but we have to ask the Commissioner, why not Africa?	5.541069020082155
As regards derivatives, I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example.	3.523900263527795
Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.	4.1158453763674165
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	3.452493640726181
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.	3.467062475074114
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures.	3.446068475894253
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks.	3.3696638759925728
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	3.172214981580573
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	4.841690091227869
.	1.3940351656188106
The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade.	4.31445671487983
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	3.876746152533219
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	3.8637916108035317
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	4.305802169970683
On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State.	3.9825710084730312
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU ' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.	4.6427648134041215
I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus.	4.277119114036371
Moreover, it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded.	5.558936908496258
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality.	3.5414036619895097
I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.	4.441713990752136
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe ' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.	5.354397885847141
Everything else is wishful thinking.	2.474968289430319
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid.	4.9295861218514005
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"	3.7816747473012904
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries ' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe.	3.693327444708027
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.	2.7869323370164993
Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States.	3.7401546524441205
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	3.0897379332258676
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	3.2837972317882826
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.	4.044141883906487
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	4.872163024223513
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.	3.4438795479294275
Parliament ' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive ' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.	3.3004770697399164
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4.	4.550194868192839
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	5.095397568071237
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.	3.4378893793153984
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	2.871919551387714
It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality.	4.358741043366618
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions, the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime.	4.321231227869359
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.	4.793054527688045
Let me turn to some of the more important points.	4.265650799625642
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	4.291146391214043
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues.	4.627760950513255
So much for the first comment.	4.3613625994732095
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	4.452579857643069
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	3.5259463996291753
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.	4.668540802503019
However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these.	4.3431303213273305
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	4.218887708638834
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.	3.967040941909935
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.	3.98382308918048
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.	4.658368704446008
In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby.	3.8382785939189543
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development.	4.426708953977968
Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.	3.338563739308078
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue.	3.68227348649248
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible.	3.229405963961286
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.	2.3987946351381937
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	3.7882103555810813
We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations, which is a delicate and sensitive phase, by exploiting tensions.	3.7433756476601188
Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.	4.329118367671664
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.	4.077909199419923
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy	2.0731083559062715
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	3.330199848150498
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.	3.9732892800496966
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women ' s voices.	4.551253556135647
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference.	4.423194315593944
Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions.	2.460563412248179
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission 's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	5.250132788081788
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	3.8149846174803463
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	3.8600183859639037
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about.	5.806008990566948
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	3.3159158490413287
Firstly the agreement on political issues.	3.0201534807547064
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region.	4.324650470059356
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.	3.969950075487636
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	2.8354578258753795
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them, particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country ' s own pre-accession strategy agenda.	5.408196178375004
As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.	3.84193693616383
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	3.2159095065874745
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.	4.885455753155595
As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee.	3.309981109515186
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	3.919204480903389
All this is to the good of the consumer.	3.7430222694035673
Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation.	3.763036257462617
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.	3.5402527068528538
This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.	4.947147284690516
The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107.	2.069993460007106
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach.	3.8724743696410133
Those rights are, by definition, universal.	3.2636520422399986
However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca ' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.	3.632594264597515
I agree with your analysis.	4.829389609775519
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this.	3.78661416339146
On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.	3.623389892506396
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	4.941831942571044
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.	4.563300307766512
Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future.	4.2589048628203585
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.	2.7932174739577955
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	3.8879305961962096
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.	3.1909655524658165
Madam President, I did not want to disturb you a minute ago during the vote.	3.394388568467779
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged.	4.7460084456666145
However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.	4.876773217457211
Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade.	4.791146759664735
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	4.379047308368666
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.	3.8545968437058216
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee ' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously.	3.5579994975406364
Today ' s problems cannot be solved in five years.	2.4833461994110313
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.	4.078300510857976
The European Union ' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	3.6390864093116213
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne ' s question.	5.201310710914608
Mr President, you are a symbol of these changes.	4.3241427694215435
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.	3.758537575217645
Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.	4.645654022345795
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products.	3.5698523308022136
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):	2.782948844335355
The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales.	3.4158436529294507
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	2.79605594662141
We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate.	4.477854067487291
Note that this proposed tax, which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people, would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation. Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere.	3.5726461980748243
The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today.	3.347031157519144
Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union.	2.8347385482682923
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	3.8087168279900996
Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.	4.302759670913169
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.	3.5166855433166453
If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up.	3.933355421621929
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds.	4.985087677454573
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria ' s Freedom Party.	3.37352762735766
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.	3.7159967412529156
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	5.107231785919083
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	4.557783197905731
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence.	3.8842981690440905
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	3.333240541921387
I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.	3.1690995228051233
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	4.397508769857759
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.	4.015600612090481
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	4.490748791781299
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance.	4.036335243214022
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.	2.6902414202501608
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it.	5.119476964971511
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out.	3.591381467890058
Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which, from an agronomic point of view, and since I come from a southern country, I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive.	4.089321558143792
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.	5.68516981548026
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.	5.012614070233592
For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States ' social security systems" .	4.540033986380125
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	3.935685896707578
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.	4.0858627958550455
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	3.3384538738328824
But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.	3.1107230468104445
At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients.	2.5558901274968946
Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect.	4.14642931729343
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States.	3.967629322794781
It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.	3.4372534614796284
Secondly, the financial contributions.	3.958783917399852
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany ' s defence savings.	3.3359270072682325
Will you confirm what is the case?	3.6905495771558203
We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions.	3.586368561616136
In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.	3.4752776108174173
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model ' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	3.710932912331943
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	4.172156918730812
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.	4.775321779554695
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business.	4.327090518614333
Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union.	4.30042072359877
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest.	3.4136759996630057
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	3.8347562787110747
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	5.137151399355548
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	3.3371703660969017
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.	2.9674456274776873
One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	3.6713498352803775
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups.	3.647387314728191
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters.	4.995613508009731
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated.	3.8198536538750427
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	4.9720245278124695
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.4428665320453087
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	1.7684995801033925
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities.	3.5904606001790933
I think we need to seize the opportunity.	4.9543115399067075
In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies.	3.183542275452004
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union	4.1101232488828
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	3.4409953500524146
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction, in its December conclusions, at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission, which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal, together with similar contributions made by Member States.	3.372079999235029
It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union.	4.584004843955996
Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol.	3.76432057439408
It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.	3.8754252157215068
It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term.	3.4009182669745983
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	2.8753722909078947
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.	4.793457271973613
However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them.	3.619054536966569
It is something that we can all support.	5.834516380688765
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission ' s staff.	4.7672513833292784
The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water.	3.641660898202207
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	3.6483929981914622
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.	3.784071699702492
Agreement on comitology	2.4156533627144765
A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated, and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project.	4.182849284770088
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	4.350953065225291
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	4.877576007134852
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.	4.267955742225831
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.	4.897899509367777
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	2.8684242322731643
Modernising social protection	2.2824477176208204
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.	3.9411425244111706
If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany.	2.888786733908942
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	4.045290772664745
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.	3.692873923385364
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent.	2.7349016648391893
However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations.	4.550683445197014
Opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe: "This Directive would be unfair since, for example, the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples ".	2.494734655031728
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	4.8169777272025325
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.	6.292388653822826
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets.	3.106356109601343
Finally, the Commission 's human resource policy must be modernised.	4.097185756128038
The European Union is a system based on law.	4.075421742438755
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory.	4.189094472252419
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach.	3.6311875523479573
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings.	3.170962590199338
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.	3.3417013133476146
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.	4.311723021714725
That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.	4.303324041279884
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	5.227609652078653
Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility.	3.79825998843781
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.	2.305142305598541
Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon.	3.764042072190126
At the Commission ' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	4.4520625208374325
Action is not limited to legislation.	2.7308009826076933
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	4.754652251677241
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House.	3.5945106014876855
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?	4.553347156292724
Since then, expectations have been high.	3.072680169823429
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.	4.64044351082014
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	4.061453532382623
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	2.9850161095903136
. (FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.	3.9515389498249904
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.	3.9660006058182216
Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.	4.507335528918936
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.	3.231732692688707
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other, make it urgently necessary to define those rights.	3.4122606210780893
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.	5.627914572806215
The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year ' s General Assembly, certainly not at the Geneva session.	4.583957187987776
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	3.5241672176013084
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.	3.992841298565166
It is the Member States ' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	4.01827958290816
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	5.42947107336042
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.	3.485966488988991
With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.	3.3468724787771924
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	4.111004147583951
From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance.	3.364188381522861
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?	2.3673665160193527
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	4.028538074081182
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	2.953442586288257
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	3.934601602939918
In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country.	4.320277083634086
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians.	4.154533212935152
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate.	3.889433719535069
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	4.5151965369202305
This is where Mr Solana, the High Representative to the Council, could come into his own.	4.282444938437647
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.	4.653492031350584
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher ' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.	3.508837542195967
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion ' rather than 'regional development ' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.	4.330999482193468
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.	4.205600558176238
By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.	4.016716275598723
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one.	3.9478046792897765
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer ' s freedom of choice.	3.467400777508929
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?	3.003223880457511
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them.	3.205965915739966
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	2.2995139097932444
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here?	3.5635322342137044
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.	4.6805869722735824
I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved.	3.957622015135904
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	3.2176858070548047
This is my first point regarding the policy.	3.899083380632605
We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU.	3.4285792220663733
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.	5.083301230386854
Is one free when security is no longer assured?	4.321997108759839
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey ' s intransigence.	3.665599237070357
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer ' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer?	4.42693606632527
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	4.391390776751138
I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia, in Galicia, for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products, on a site which will only employ three workers. This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa, where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry.	3.454301210851978
I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke ' s speech in particular, in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union.	4.429508076006726
In yesterday ' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State.	4.939071380600985
As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods.	4.149168481657035
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.	5.8425144558250635
My vote was "in favour" .	3.6341432821973316
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.	4.007127968801686
In other words, it is positive discrimination.	3.8627023842626467
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too.	4.1616956590969805
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	2.8121293956070175
And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow.	4.175059718280538
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.	4.895512345289474
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.	3.5292067562112313
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication.	4.709810035104243
Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one.	4.16323083586248
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	4.862798181345819
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.	2.8168662247472884
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.	6.510452387479683
The crisis in last year ' s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution.	4.2982947379869705
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	4.19978375020049
More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.	3.9476489450916796
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political.	4.264597344686181
The Commission ' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.	3.605310745281226
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.	5.2013803624960655
We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious.	4.116054252889075
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	4.62515787380573
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government.	2.212776257093777
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.700323732039262
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.	2.7954518615293895
It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector.	3.444036394884825
Is this too much of a burden?	3.669192811870698
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you.	3.0567976687936875
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.	3.1432436441165503
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	2.159500962020671
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food.	4.78431767962464
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable.	4.055201705667907
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	3.838500069499488
As has already been pointed out, in one month ' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.	3.3496586079025366
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	5.183312055984549
(Loud applause)	1.0387039174734527
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.	4.393672599208449
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	3.0354199593413225
Current programmes must be accelerated.	2.209748867951157
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.	4.139928887985904
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?	4.577390373902148
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	4.553830479597245
Is this right and proper?	3.6669578607491893
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	3.600901936618706
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	3.2937391656076387
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.	4.244273206216157
Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations?	4.065042089420403
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.	5.0171609038602245
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	4.938014934989854
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.	3.800075320631163
But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth.	4.1241512256402055
As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June.	4.1044565808414095
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent.	3.50668955796222
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	3.5580598580444023
It was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre, thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible.	3.098131969400783
As the report itself indicates, the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period, which were already low, at EUR 900 million. Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.	3.8387962391799517
That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon ' perfectly legal.	3.251582413861646
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	3.681559004456945
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted.	3.497624672576083
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner.	4.0971544696741695
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%.	3.625949814849548
A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.	3.4587382039449057
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000.	4.143827619648262
I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear, proper economic and biological picture emerging.	4.045859940572231
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	4.990770277242805
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.	4.495415501730494
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	3.848535974155345
One of the reasons for the Community ' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment.	3.365242755573749
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily.	5.863213752882421
I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity.	3.6877280539457553
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.	4.256545600476951
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?	5.107913514874789
I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed.	3.8879931924481603
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.	4.097872269512459
To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan.	3.4426410966939835
We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.	3.387341033301956
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France 's refusal to lift the ban?	3.843655536368523
Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks.	2.493751220227634
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.	4.071295236134107
In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged.	3.7811945432402063
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.	4.143664924526376
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	2.775588824865503
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.	4.418581015061708
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all?	5.185869346521348
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	4.300963682537896
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	3.042832068120551
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	4.408788171333613
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.	4.6742534344697635
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	3.2307102505458465
It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union.	4.0734121094537645
These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT. This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament ' s role.	4.944407033672167
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole.	3.3977680925475804
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.	2.824991603896596
Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission ' s and Council ' s efforts in this respect.	5.133257336796959
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	5.909188886623186
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	3.189800656278817
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	4.091064034521714
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council.	3.000331367896605
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.	4.917289470087875
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development.	4.413778969779029
A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.	2.6613652852578156
Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter.	3.2503504257397786
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	4.38694771989359
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text.	4.662634694462012
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.	4.3114716295092546
Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union.	3.6033165375237903
It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape.	3.817905531150864
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.	3.455161907208051
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	3.8725061377100487
And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries.	4.142758965062907
Proposal for a joint resolution on human rights	2.291433097401266
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider.	4.013291314584478
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	4.992458484275057
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	5.204144532570172
Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU.	3.1080392337770184
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission ' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy.	4.341588110245731
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.	3.0552047457155953
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	4.374870947158614
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	4.140010798538878
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	4.698860391743665
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union ' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	4.048329567446142
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	3.826051362063188
Clear progress must be visible.	1.869591383083008
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals.	3.361678276466608
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applicability.	3.5178003568751945
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission ' s supervision.	5.521128294415547
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	4.248931477434778
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	3.5050709646580036
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	5.809188046798525
Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution.	2.4804013284040494
It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda.	3.8182747612053825
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	4.845128766022985
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue.	3.3776063670423127
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.	4.283532753408128
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late.	2.8481042058880948
Yet we do not have much time.	2.7867309395430184
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	4.108106168477719
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	2.9323704685184793
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	3.547288438008607
We have taken good note of your intentions.	5.015728988151351
Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission ' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)	2.7002461199230283
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria, and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens.	5.070982986318712
Two questions if I may.	2.5839683551711925
I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance.	3.3132567693134263
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	3.06400351788844
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control ' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.	6.469856464266885
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.	4.448128915271776
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame.	3.6721388598172986
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	2.2774270521605056
Report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( 'Culture 2000 ') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)	1.8791260191944277
I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	4.843738920173276
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	3.379547094019228
It is also of great importance to citizens.	5.26867512667273
They want answers.	4.165360074211258
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	3.0288864341468686
The Commission ' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.	4.63619350113695
However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.	3.781505167750679
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities ' . The European Union ' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.	4.5673599099245195
It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history ' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	3.085266559720812
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.	3.3199750029551103
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	6.53118879504125
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole.	4.360683484858852
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	3.6886203233699555
It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage.	3.3372369568809126
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	3.8753655163304646
The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been.	5.135824916164676
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.	3.1673929110358165
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	4.054477216335193
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as "Europe 's scapegoat" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive.	3.175557565574613
Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like.	4.661888013035775
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy.	3.7985188324882673
It is important that business has legal certainty.	2.2839749651693575
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.	4.779481998750542
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights.	2.737538790461706
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force.	3.548751837913561
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises.	3.8406375176744803
And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned.	4.479737883720766
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries?	3.517264133895831
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward.	3.8047616607068946
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	4.44049609467581
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.	3.715905116055674
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.	4.206396712630892
It was very small.	4.935043578404772
I do not believe so.	4.074465663579882
Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent.	4.284710603141768
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999.	3.3562208630926778
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.	3.983782148531541
The common position is not ambitious enough.	4.906817266372736
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too.	4.339458920639231
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	3.214855752296389
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	4.58990960963052
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	4.0519663817401845
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	3.3253992854111063
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	5.200391453560799
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.	3.867804697345883
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there.	4.8937188944603385
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	4.449592233086409
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	4.076297843754924
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	3.296979164444473
The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission ' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level.	4.208980766792261
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very meagre opening offer.	5.425095590994058
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	4.866921226652005
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm.	4.415018485336176
Helsinki was an historic event, an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point.	2.4589692938082828
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	3.940807656619327
. (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union ' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.	4.976891178054196
As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective.	3.3579264562323026
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.	3.908127705928946
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French.	3.1685441232235174
This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces.	3.784690369263839
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	3.584676330583228
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	3.7081914221738037
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union ' s role in international development policies is significant.	4.492037237923427
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	5.218721793438201
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	5.2362789378000425
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	4.105916879510733
Criminal law is part of each individual nation ' s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts.	4.448508327947801
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	2.1602733603551907
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council.	3.5328639552420333
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation.	3.939357506225864
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.	4.9293425899025225
I may have missed it in the list she gave out.	5.948932042669233
That is naturally unacceptable.	3.9135452268636404
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today.	4.29004891624213
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	4.642695025798825
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	2.7595110552257407
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.	7.067928434477633
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	2.9857452516613936
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	5.159058874089067
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.	4.0164760763960805
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	4.377161247176855
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.	4.0180676083307665
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	3.7961216510304054
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	4.2340540587119495
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.	4.013246094517946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.8840611680037562
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten ' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises.	4.018337299073271
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	4.6755599985043785
On the contrary, it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history.	3.9443509236249388
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	3.7790310037806534
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	2.5912629400476757
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	4.230263558507209
I certainly appreciate that.	4.933015267846372
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	3.8699756399091574
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost.	2.3648549891114827
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection.	3.761507832841271
The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.	3.9887143524037407
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.	4.355421013299812
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?	3.8064820331168914
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)	2.1234918768489557
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.	5.358302550929554
But this is not in place.	5.748250963907379
We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented.	4.687696093913707
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point. Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.	3.2097665867531022
Mr President, this morning ' s debate is very important.	3.717689793391816
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	4.008093200636142
However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons.	3.86827065292055
Apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the Community market, what we term 'development aid ' to the ACP has fallen constantly, from 70% of total European Union aid in 1986 to 30% in 1998.	3.0579044755687166
Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	3.667232800871252
Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States.	3.51469635227721
But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself.	5.607667463116231
If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused.	4.032939207892859
Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done.	2.2637593628900903
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	5.686017031473614
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3811274786686611
On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women.	2.8065919750275072
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).	4.063294484071446
As rightly said by the rapporteur, both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval.	4.764493621613724
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply.	3.6589058314183687
I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front.	3.429221295568919
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge.	4.713970118908331
Thirdly, the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources.	3.37815622598701
Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.5226321654703523
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	1.8863810877139062
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.	3.8104683463405915
Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women.	2.7946500480780494
So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation.	5.359361764795376
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs.	3.622111072412105
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	5.0375663049086485
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	3.737217878270006
This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing.	5.264008710207479
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.	3.539394050308584
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.	3.113237896033684
Mr President, today ' s debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress.	3.2447759277334125
Agenda	1.0709171446689894
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.	5.653523057687898
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.	3.6208951106521305
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	4.525219331078746
Cultural activity creates identity.	2.1856244854291007
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	3.447716887158446
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.	3.825803460696589
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs.	3.703427563715852
Does it reflect this vision of coherence?	3.0330769514624656
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	5.0436167253904065
The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	4.402653262186765
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.	3.885885300099082
Is the Council discussing this issue?	2.511944599638778
Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.	3.6004287366804766
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue.	4.212011715330558
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well.	5.678740359082662
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.	4.268264393503474
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	4.233550292050808
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas.	2.546514446354327
I am far keener to see us move away from today 's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg.	3.1395060128294277
Does the Council consider that, on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty, national legislation on transparency can be regulated, that is to say legislation not relating to the EU ' s institutions?	3.941277591867017
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.	3.8527564967314767
Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well.	2.9074585531566335
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems.	3.966809273487272
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	4.086737893391116
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject.	3.174598444035249
I would also like to make a more general point.	4.6414222492804775
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	3.467779691999631
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order.	4.589511820842067
That is our role and this is the point of my question.	5.53147514390581
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.	4.796036912931273
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.6688069022930805
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	3.062023107998634
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	3.4055808600169732
The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either.	5.414323545109298
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements.	5.247457717951916
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.	4.731577257131958
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide.	4.589410015926072
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage.	4.606998698483114
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%.	3.441844201862294
This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs.	4.645166968201635
Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself.	3.023408629157816
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.	4.052536671111377
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	4.117678031767448
Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors.	3.4284367772205426
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.	4.4508871179498
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development.	4.194125948699999
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider ' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	3.627099562402049
Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed.	4.083114661322476
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	4.390114187511263
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	6.582205880004889
This is not the case!	4.272390164120572
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.	3.828692122389574
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	4.153472247867515
These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.	3.1307985855400755
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	4.148654796959764
. Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday.	4.045228160874257
I can speak for my party, which championed Austria ' s membership of the European Union in the early days.	4.7410113848758915
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union ' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	4.435925541130356
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).	3.594751108915737
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	3.4664052568993484
Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens.	3.008941216130786
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	2.4495686334389517
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.	3.081956327527936
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	4.161193963067003
However, I must again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher.	3.927884485971977
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	3.7905710182718484
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	3.897425662276432
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.	4.479967015328937
That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, "mono" problems.	3.8584544249260015
In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States.	4.458059994938019
It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it.	4.178932963385086
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.	4.341793897414951
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	3.616583716475185
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries.	2.7415231466619496
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions.	5.148648477104675
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.	3.7123672903791403
Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce.	4.141911974433518
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament ' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate.	4.128522363684891
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death.	3.270739036935118
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.	4.077379390389311
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women.	3.4084398076569555
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)	2.0185499309566515
However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?	3.926665975536662
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	4.0478800648797755
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle.	3.915469265023899
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual ' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.	3.2284951004011195
I cannot think of a better way to do it.	5.0239508679988045
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament ' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	4.248824171969955
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.	4.874530439739124
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	4.440741394480945
There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive.	4.036751398232809
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	4.461497133910999
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	3.1037828555208615
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict.	3.536977472211513
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	3.685434854961578
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.	3.9309480421426186
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	4.773581920407681
The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget.	4.460872843753981
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	3.8460773358944307
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct.	5.49104617672017
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	3.97164867376585
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press.	3.690738674261665
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mentioned, we must remember that there is still room for progress.	3.4789356509195386
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	4.439690534591109
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.	4.237131507014075
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers.	3.5334171652489172
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	5.4751260682881675
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn.	4.261898276217147
In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative.	4.043585910652994
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	5.201794442054692
Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.	3.695454083718972
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	3.8464251910330454
Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission ' s statement.	4.613437034585895
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.	3.7452006393727038
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	3.700819014179142
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.	4.0027104003012886
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	2.297357222282406
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	4.31666408491954
We share them with everyone on this earth.	4.315768403303997
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false.	3.913435267706696
When I read Mr van Hulten ' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	3.3706989773272364
It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration ' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended.	4.021507189225566
Cyprus and Malta	2.85151317655179
But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation.	4.0139623241017635
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	5.658217540318866
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?	3.8120077634693774
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.	3.8558104566206604
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	5.550049757984805
I should like to make just a few comments.	4.765171756121248
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs.	5.647085295529368
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	4.0968599143915885
With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels.	3.5710789876520117
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.	4.544720732383535
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	2.7595029191372804
Recourse to the precautionary principle	3.4866633921821903
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	3.449338808431502
Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency.	4.381104762441681
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	5.6383966531549845
These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms.	4.123176603077281
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.	3.8875748346781687
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them.	3.8582582309687155
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	4.404178771242967
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	4.359363391336763
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.	4.083245406743112
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	4.113241042021288
Personally, I am pleased with some of the replies, for example, in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention, which we hope will be reviewed, and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.	4.115001907187674
It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact.	3.592111242528511
The call for women ' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women ' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.	4.095741073583178
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.	4.169865033259804
That is not what we want to do in Europe.	4.456893043563331
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	3.8243951313466824
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999.	3.9167281509272764
They know full well that they should not commit these acts.	4.250968753451971
Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said.	3.2360427826272975
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions.	4.213029188408628
Tourism and employment	3.9167570542597607
Di Pietro report (A5-0019/2000)	2.5905076797926165
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives.	3.6986174001021
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened.	2.873178379751738
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long.	2.1756610849670075
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	2.415089994635049
Mr President, the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations, based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe, for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent.	4.094830674758347
I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women ' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field.	3.6379404939717452
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.	4.680749677631606
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas.	4.039324753683081
Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank.	4.7559853924213344
The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108.	2.457808494105787
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	4.009183135053863
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	4.40363536571609
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	4.571227384308854
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today ' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.	4.528614663511467
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread.	4.863722872852859
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm.	3.6565875944645305
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	3.328890096419989
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.	4.3553323871473415
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
This report is a wake-up call to Europe.	3.6776803683283634
It is time we stopped this trend.	3.7675303157238567
The Council ' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret.	4.411126820622917
These include, for example, costs and transfers.	3.7597952698848633
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety.	3.7452794457754024
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	5.027450850765007
Secondly, the new "in" word is flexibility.	2.8713553219487005
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate?	3.1048081303302957
Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission.	4.359907687714397
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free.	4.068903301451337
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	3.8874633167096464
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	4.417807674621086
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	4.293530328794299
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	3.230062961660875
This is unacceptable to my mind.	4.234859842986998
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy.	4.190473557359254
While only around 10% of the world ' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there.	3.0745821381473553
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.	6.107019971247457
Mr President, Commissioner, in this minute and a half I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Schroedter.	4.459205469795019
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	4.6784472285803185
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today.	4.5496662183143926
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	3.183535191984773
So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources.	4.101185202439375
I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council.	3.653766233691775
Finally, even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies, there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected, and that is not the intention.	4.904227192549073
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	3.4470910044262286
This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity.	6.214948182329003
These aspects are very much interconnected.	5.363718171761062
To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned.	3.8635358655155203
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.	4.235020766684221
We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia.	4.175766160392353
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves?	4.353087704189838
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!	3.0287218001839866
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988.	3.6517954859408155
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	4.595017566007618
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible.	4.206846193090138
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.	4.0648961494636655
First of all, many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality, and increases poverty.	2.5292245419349184
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.	3.1802181002932466
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate?	2.813949083422523
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process.	2.2816250370411573
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon.	4.414737224118695
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.	3.213352064615802
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries ' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	2.978394180143418
Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you.	3.8539268923240435
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	3.302996670779725
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.	3.179832551484484
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.	3.6066070539012642
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	3.857649988794526
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	5.254515464141682
As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another.	2.994098127250013
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re-read the Commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office.	3.4676063001697233
They have all been persuaded!	3.4076269412350424
Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.	4.169028621368288
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact.	3.4971756793642106
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.	5.139226857065581
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	3.0102816572362667
These initiatives, together with effective systems of control, are the key aspects for the future of fisheries.	4.347812318329135
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.	3.597134415997701
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.	3.874372902022102
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks.	3.7704810095234285
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this.	4.523356765260838
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	3.3642446601681812
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken.	3.89578210561385
Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced.	2.408249060069786
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission ' s social programme.	4.970733270562969
If we do this, then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount.	3.21654741732151
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis.	4.320263804352716
It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.	4.249638260826472
Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers.	3.8995309383345615
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.8005890760472703
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.	4.562139509669141
We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms.	4.639021401167009
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	3.9296935190997733
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	5.644565093840915
And this is not pure chance.	4.3411437259888705
With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers ' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job.	3.6433423294337053
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	3.3641208541744034
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.	4.605884366835022
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan?	3.236514058063195
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	4.917445994789998
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	4.052544037327707
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables.	4.587873487897368
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	3.2407178087532587
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today.	3.2574040824915005
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	3.3135028989608584
This is also true of development cooperation.	4.476923084582328
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world ' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	3.0031685314735026
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	1.1272086066868192
We can deal with it.	4.3710123584985165
Whose turn is next?	2.2012803635587472
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	4.7865899501841565
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	4.52663704770841
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.	3.30500219677599
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.	4.968063317529789
Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones.	4.651473106200701
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	4.578234646069694
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre.	3.391209175434056
I do not think so.	3.0086627089238913
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.	4.391019342124117
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now.	3.113783818607072
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	3.0651397448150313
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.	3.908753679755332
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.	3.7163245070405497
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments.	3.6147525995367884
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	3.334684265128043
The newspaper reports were misleading.	5.881359554830342
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future.	5.471970156513621
The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle.	4.2279731359077966
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.	4.921864310251917
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	5.092066526733199
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.	4.394272661988242
The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers?	4.406968024559415
I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water.	6.22247331140344
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	3.714466678546259
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions.	4.521285606796653
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	3.6961325403078114
You say there will be no further funding.	4.717110768968416
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.	4.972053399356611
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	4.694780980651762
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic ' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.	4.429602159227314
Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly.	4.614609275322789
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues.	5.029299068507561
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	2.04409523449518
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue.	2.9393421741504286
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997?	2.9945583186789624
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	4.237544276015834
That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.	3.9314532821144432
It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations.	3.359649964252842
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	3.683391723533586
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard.	2.7381617607462583
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	3.134990615912126
- (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999.	4.326875718289449
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere.	4.126532908289594
Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community ' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement.	3.7332908881319664
President.	1.3240504952729728
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	3.741744360705796
We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees.	3.7679826376156758
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	2.9720943345966147
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit.	3.2460228230127406
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.	3.744834476050774
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.	3.1700058216672717
That is not the route that has been taken.	4.132912055689471
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	3.9957908965877786
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	3.505671233732118
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.	4.016281150994733
This was an important consideration for us.	4.2272867684360245
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.	4.395830527664747
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.	2.959010396148166
It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation.	3.940557847806144
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly.	2.9001988910135204
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	4.265633920470154
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	3.543264979209919
We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.	4.029410861157545
When it comes to tourism, we can no longer do what we like where we like.	3.2124511637254005
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.	3.8790904694707704
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	3.4851380024951166
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	4.9028901346847
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	3.156907679659123
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights?	3.3701982060367635
The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.	3.8091939482971644
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency ' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.	4.212680918314716
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.	3.9773232855302334
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom, Security and Justice.	3.1561330941169263
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.	3.415107019686851
I welcome Mr Amadeus ' statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU ' s emerging common foreign and security policy.	3.3387399895152097
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.	3.814611614855236
Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP.	2.746494416423607
We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up.	4.262508618049696
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	4.201301094468964
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe ' s economy.	4.528668825491773
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	4.680510929090002
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	2.9016152337635477
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.	7.527181252517485
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added.	3.943441960504713
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	4.151721684247943
It must be a 'development round ' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included.	3.4005385267648833
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	6.360216476934967
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today.	4.1866399245583805
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ.	4.018867437820443
The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million.	3.810535534336113
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	4.281964701615656
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice.	3.606695891329822
We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard.	4.269936050249819
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.	4.8220059668500985
Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively.	3.4768788243011937
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	3.180064250466671
Böge report (A5-0023/2000)	2.122098947834351
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	5.434981539052283
That is my conclusion today.	3.5157618896915666
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	3.5983498331213384
The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years.	4.965370200016284
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001.	4.66118599236887
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.	3.0576963696021546
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.5058264775679655
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	4.828092954953092
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	4.8195766996414005
Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique.	3.4210859463939074
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.	3.5843257015903025
Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.	3.5129498800922048
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step.	4.988115509154034
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.	4.0257989197959745
The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves.	4.000785611058036
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	3.033969126098246
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	3.630921870264325
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	2.875439497937952
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.	3.268275546698902
Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans.	2.7702254361061254
Resumption of the sitting	2.076544998915669
Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe.	4.676325422254275
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	3.54320489352829
I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water.	3.8101915129680144
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	3.4611265579922765
As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers.	3.8682813035353
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.	5.607395248574759
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	3.253602759150112
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states.	3.8919553891391505
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils ' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	3.075297276347462
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.	3.289733247836799
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	3.176214869361677
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	3.196503138231377
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police.	2.8248755297244417
This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda.	4.1564945597822796
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless.	4.090877090748275
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	3.4430504095922427
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit.	3.0784957883474773
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.	4.867715546584268
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.	5.204785332507092
In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly.	4.130494080504189
Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality.	2.782400347005846
There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising ' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy ' are not used.	2.8799910812419016
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	5.855097025636255
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves.	4.058840452905522
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	3.090926665832628
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately.	5.6518976969142765
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	3.6591944629239515
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.	2.806773471847566
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	3.867164970131879
There is no freedom without rules.	3.132467296091029
For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies.	3.881000269152792
We are seeking to implement best practice.	4.256204863865399
But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others.	3.531246258487071
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.	4.171578871120179
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	4.601497744409409
First OSPAR.	4.283916317762055
. (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission ' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union.	3.854803313905544
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	4.095792349118104
What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.	5.7581304399239785
Do you think I am going over the top?	3.589145559244745
There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report.	4.199017723651084
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	3.366163761501312
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	3.4281420579344393
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.	3.2681917973748016
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative.	3.588108553184119
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	4.215000189591731
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission 's proposal.	3.6052187390234933
Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies.	3.787101138002698
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.	5.379195858790214
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.	4.954924795588059
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.	4.545641677479498
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.	3.9105658920278796
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996.	2.085259554493074
The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention.	4.233866050965469
Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment.	3.211452118370603
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	4.617251642227084
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	6.127701530582879
Has it been discussed?	2.367987952037132
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe ' s meagre resources.	2.95953950806732
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	4.358843816874502
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	3.439559176298046
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors.	6.109282624130533
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	3.9459946160767947
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community ' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.	3.6534150174344386
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	4.07928205977985
It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced.	3.4205638427270024
Furthermore, this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission ' s involvement in this undertaking.	6.157740937223436
If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish ' .	3.9910086833314025
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives.	2.9763510072809987
I do not think so.	3.0086627089238913
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission ' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];	2.3985038764228306
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	4.197475484183363
This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy.	4.186764902964716
This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment.	3.2197772156037012
The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind.	4.0902462402574775
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	4.866616717317719
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol ' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.	4.3224566312754
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	7.290365734412766
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.	3.7455352646115516
The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.	4.073431942179541
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	5.193788210718654
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.	3.158754120995562
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment.	3.309399356069962
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.	2.212247771677679
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	5.744618603553492
. (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community ' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States.	3.260020601701698
In this respect, the Commission ' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament ' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	3.8254668336226403
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	4.2081482661027625
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past.	3.9793743733495712
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	3.5124119446726603
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector.	2.8400927741101025
Parliament ' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations.	3.386015016910546
It is clear that is not acceptable.	4.622652722016583
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.	3.683838595540279
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	2.830285529212093
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	2.3394833057481574
As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive.	3.733949793835209
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding.	3.3051009138550307
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important.	6.713886139595397
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.	5.620885623614623
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.	3.669127443009498
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.	4.383483240392329
Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee.	3.719273671625435
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights.	4.5121329358161075
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee.	3.1313929033153256
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission ' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	5.005832556904907
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved.	3.492779904549571
All workers in the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard.	4.240286179903668
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	4.247081306931062
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	4.17434801905936
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it.	2.992392998480204
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.	4.364380928548102
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	2.73572190322329
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi 's programme.	3.516633879610986
Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face.	3.7365808702498855
This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.	3.870006617722553
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	3.773103706132928
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions ' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.	4.236503076644567
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	5.288322909550696
However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law.	3.573740148964771
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of, and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often.	4.617949149590324
Will the Commission remain silent?	2.7938361169190977
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.	3.412207243483452
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year.	4.763141894598001
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food.	2.664219121208992
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	3.197589575033823
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water.	3.351005713539359
Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding 'the language ' of the guest member state, especially when there are various official languages, and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages.	3.331176079411143
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	4.188950884718118
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.	4.543348119867962
Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.	3.934326698355096
I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience.	3.8644578500093067
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	3.433645400466805
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.	3.315362618996474
However, I would like to concentrate on two points.	3.69025543352254
Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions.	3.812142362488776
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	3.366353953571325
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	3.4261324829757136
The nature of the EU has not changed.	10.70859274446314
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.	3.8153803182742667
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council.	4.0103870492428
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.	5.069512750375616
The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions.	4.367349822401465
In addition to incorporating a new methodology, this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations, on account of the aforesaid methodological changes, and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates.	3.4774750355148982
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.	4.273886872605976
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.	5.072257890845352
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled.	4.754823470045862
The maritime world has great potential.	5.242121617834196
Firstly, for the single market.	3.596055952208396
Finally, as regards the Council ' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery.	4.520860467288938
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM.	4.949430265883587
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	5.230319289177234
In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of "Ten Commandments" : a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points.	4.080419694219947
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	3.4107954168115686
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	3.52702081504995
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	4.221050575124712
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.	4.1194446883638856
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	4.553833067154725
In any case, the authoritative version is always, of course, the original language version.	3.8850559944273906
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day.	3.875402006327187
Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead.	2.4266487461425217
If it were, Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which is, of course, unacceptable.	4.359813507939189
Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.	3.663576180470722
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	4.4028383893343666
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed.	4.312895559470018
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States ' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	3.9747510667135906
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	3.194419229590307
Today, nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems, with Internet at the sharp end, mobile telephones and digital television, are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models.	3.344247396299113
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	4.9626774041328074
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.	2.8149974160711615
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	4.220476601133796
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	3.347912831815297
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	6.060212507620963
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	3.999805456052777
However, the EU ' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature.	4.496346700782186
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	4.308382539192325
Hence his disappearance of over one month.	2.7740530382375574
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
The problem has been overcome.	5.760770493110608
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level.	3.610248862639894
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	4.732378117238148
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	5.047113315108459
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.	5.627950380608597
On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves.	3.3205225172296213
Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements.	4.234768545918801
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	4.195276062475711
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.	4.72683266884596
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions.	4.066714609574502
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	3.1194460150068473
At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem.	4.192907424145333
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market.	4.129711302240182
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	3.5647983055236097
As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation.	4.436423595649036
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	4.694235058991509
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols, and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on cyber crime.	4.6183654227311814
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.	3.6712121294534814
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	2.689866727583711
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven ' s sake.	2.893558242606771
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.	3.839689360597713
They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.	2.730160216739246
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	4.266758623341111
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union.	3.8948039006703765
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	3.911520771828914
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	3.839254201288222
It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.	3.3064552913111354
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	4.211639979456524
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	3.370317259532483
As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia.	3.6192209856861557
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.	5.397581021978026
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	4.54073982219366
It is the humane face of Europe.	3.5121185434571185
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	4.479719269703236
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	3.4642683749240293
The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay.	4.316815730329748
That concludes Question Time.	2.387574992743204
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China.	3.531048971394353
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	4.637227893994888
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done.	4.5777011301194435
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	6.004515292328399
The latter element continues to be the Commission ' s fundamental objective, as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit, in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term.	4.792364202263989
For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further.	3.938778396956549
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent ' and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so ' .	4.331621196114637
. Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report.	3.146001245574658
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.	4.384549715221437
The postal service is also the bus service.	4.196177800982517
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.	4.881725027312829
On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	3.46107297465656
In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102.	2.5584077703580768
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	4.162225807546519
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.	4.77471467793484
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level?	5.057242061795525
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	3.1394987407549895
I must say that Alex Langer 's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved.	3.996011460529413
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.	3.461512271129226
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	3.19948617532651
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	3.37827997038569
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	4.126602385385661
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	3.45852917706836
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach.	2.3300104581746157
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.	4.203753635426055
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	4.374033963878894
We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.	5.046966593258615
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	3.335391925568071
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS).	2.0170836799689313
There is still much to be done, however.	4.1049981398621895
On the subject of human rights, I have received two proposals for additions: one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia ' and the other from the Group of the Greens, for an item entitled 'Pinochet ' .	3.564495667005008
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible.	4.023120016535886
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.	2.727349371975183
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse.	4.345950260088356
It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts.	3.462753968679757
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.	4.516928271531445
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.	3.7670826564110587
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending ' in this House, and I thank you for it.	3.6758654497620693
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	3.873528441068045
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament.	5.251566833001741
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council ' s draft decision.	3.173152592991414
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket ' .	3.9758362354823125
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep? ' .	3.339560124098806
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job.	4.5071773719679795
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?	3.5338508829085247
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	3.9358168841458485
I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.	3.9134971405596874
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country ' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice.	3.820986974053612
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.	3.9442879640504236
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability.	4.739358890375455
The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future.	3.8764455717649686
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	4.681546327232978
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	3.7629913749180934
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today.	4.190222321914325
This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability.	3.818142684356494
Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there.	3.975967542861981
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.	7.060855333035548
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.	3.0159041558155004
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	5.040385598162713
Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control, damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity.	4.4386341891506405
In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU ' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector?	3.470614249266181
In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption.	4.144605669289513
Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction.	3.7722942593527202
We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht.	4.219268187777992
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.7079857205784754
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.	4.019612431802843
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	6.462641389027745
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	4.0003299846146785
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	2.7789273022207754
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.	3.40126426527911
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	2.9652724669574493
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union ' s common foreign and security policy.	4.829280468119432
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	3.356002126078014
Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men.	4.147393061209588
The credit for Mozambique ' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique.	3.633064815730441
Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients;	3.3796972620325776
Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid.	4.259013361594904
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	3.957626538655754
Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union.	2.4174811602024144
As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team.	3.7580923581699097
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	4.863068346520588
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.	5.257957630789013
After the debacle in Seattle, our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty.	3.96501118302468
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	4.544256824522793
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	3.783245654567502
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	3.68434282033627
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty.	4.446577819058081
The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment.	4.616719185884119
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	2.875002082733691
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.	3.5318906711591636
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	4.181748658963562
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	3.9758686288407055
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	4.184638962246945
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	3.2890319784980804
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	2.348370716325077
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6283050878427754
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned.	4.47232299539701
However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State.	3.6041537552056746
It is quite the opposite.	3.68133350701564
We remain committed to eradicating the disease, an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector.	4.675365862186462
In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.	3.0740090998895817
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.	4.499411795661012
Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context.	5.510114611109933
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	4.471658893071148
LIFE ' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment;	5.1097451485860566
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	3.1290513332897114
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	4.494229384571876
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see.	4.09356192857293
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries.	2.5478460275222625
I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union ' s policy on the environment.	4.72615099914186
But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes.	3.8258453481163506
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars?	3.751704256642201
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.	3.584596135543646
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould.	4.449850444059366
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	4.317696748786507
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States	4.131889092856315
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms.	3.0095822916940063
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	3.2968094222314126
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	4.994583890368092
It is the international community, and specifically the United Nations, which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and, in particular, for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality.	4.42334140913931
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	3.0117024539999444
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. for a formal sitting on the occasion of an address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic and resumed at 12.50 p.m.)	2.5943338965924387
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures.	4.74632124683641
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	4.724461797566386
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	3.9179550734013566
However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China.	3.4863141981636816
More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity.	3.83379198661172
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?	4.058543628350588
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote.	4.687984079730545
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.	4.891558158375272
We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living.	3.6022544675224095
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	4.474478652743192
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote.	3.960395224084059
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	3.592436003960636
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex.	4.800610747364097
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed.	2.7835822303014295
Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.	4.432267068981133
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	5.3497435603049
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.	3.4064908904642075
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems.	4.014997686537217
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	5.854932815839811
Here, then, I want to point out that international competition is tough and, if we are to overcome it positively, we must together envision and share a long-term strategy.	3.933480375180618
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement.	3.8974879350004645
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	3.358725712902947
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy.	5.015128455183341
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	3.7630471966100223
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.	5.35414702340085
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.	4.258786211376269
Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party will vote in favour of the committee ' s amendments, and of course our own.	3.4529490362528574
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment.	3.509054745131661
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so.	3.7731418097408773
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.	4.428757339454423
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.	3.5557205407950248
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies.	3.6965360583184994
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.	3.804870584832011
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems.	4.678712192383663
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.	5.28809186557203
Europe ' s message, the European Union ' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	4.677602266416724
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility.	3.857302810755452
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder ' s view.	2.747317437894544
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense.	3.575620824660683
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.	4.210905892614715
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	4.352979577284333
As for the monitoring and management of these programmes, I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation.	5.084674786101159
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.	4.772242854664124
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting.	3.1136838087241188
Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	4.03441606565516
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	3.7584411241968683
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	4.130529780560078
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	3.1853931709222594
There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital.	3.143763969558231
I would like to mention one final point.	4.260923245473826
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments.	3.1118271973981106
This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat.	4.0824073729418915
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .	3.452498822381042
If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them.	4.395785492716158
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.	2.9747090976079003
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement.	3.827485056120434
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas.	3.608232963583398
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is.	4.813994436305559
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine ' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session.	4.284309706438449
That is, after all, a question the people often ask.	4.35636050394283
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development.	4.711348831767418
On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.	3.2140441373233055
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.	4.107671956585235
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	3.9156689081229863
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State ' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	3.9846674538201916
Mr Newton Dunn, I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question, and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future.	3.962686112668686
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	4.9810643599932245
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position.	4.710594135902811
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights.	3.5460076776601066
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	4.1916591663772795
The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament.	5.872864082359305
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.	3.08568224173185
Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned.	3.945680269630553
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	3.502842057417823
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
The funding of activities for the implementation, adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies, particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development, are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon.	4.1772681413981
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.	4.618148539959329
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	4.899029653786821
It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating.	4.39654716778846
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors.	4.572901089017643
This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups.	4.106891781255149
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	4.432126235682336
Rather than using the word 'enlargement ' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance.	3.0699239064693176
These are serious allegations.	3.570912893865928
Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them.	5.1438791923829195
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.	4.309812629195842
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	4.456919687753522
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People ' s Party has been advocating for some time.	3.7785512286860845
On the second part of Mr Harbour ' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	4.255289941868
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	4.3514548292164745
In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People ' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources.	3.7856854231546437
Shipwreck of the Erika	3.3722725328359413
Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these.	4.732998635465251
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British?	3.6306420687170218
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	3.1215423870121577
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are?	3.6533986691561546
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer ' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union ' s budget.	4.052787130528796
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today ' s agenda has come full circle.	4.01113692861821
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources.	4.65684777827063
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency.	4.789179224328607
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	4.038875477725329
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	3.7925827587359864
It is equally true, however, that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II.	4.564942692232706
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	4.658697952943469
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented.	7.496447723528299
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone.	4.813078366799076
A report on the work to be undertaken, together with the Member States and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now.	4.900015975697749
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	4.006458758898218
It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe.	3.2412644090238873
The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation.	4.29886920422359
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	3.619415858485139
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament ' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	5.530216338183739
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	3.197543245525846
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	3.8800940634130665
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment.	5.21891777840906
I will give you an example.	3.9758275842648105
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	3.6265082321515
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	3.4620302915186985
In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff.	4.482272197873428
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie ' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.	4.079522423001222
It is just a question of how.	5.382463029409753
Welcome	1.0963497644087596
We consider the English version to be the original text.	5.183676734036301
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider.	3.0091602196050133
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.	4.4659731466554815
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	3.7596659710665707
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.	3.8269319805770934
This service must therefore be kept public.	6.413842003807383
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	3.7638230731547213
This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia.	4.477183944277601
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	4.0962846858284605
The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously.	4.428963855489191
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right.	2.9757213581978874
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier ' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	3.354838365782306
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.	4.229779426347756
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	3.5832850825586773
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	3.883257304910664
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?	3.0476581594854655
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary.	4.9610556655756355
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.	3.3424320765844433
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President, Fernando Cardoso, the Finnish Government, the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995.	3.493546174782797
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi.	3.391645082891658
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	5.08893526741621
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves.	4.565489175583417
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.	4.007953742543737
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	4.2629003362661475
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?	3.0298787976555426
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	4.740914552617183
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.	5.0434595352056375
The after-shocks can still be felt.	5.989450463760624
Until 1999, this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols (B7-4011).	2.9751960081016953
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.	4.409412970474476
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	3.8556477079679494
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector.	3.4595195856504226
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	5.446222832822281
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars.	3.2128584922161516
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment.	5.307118367082637
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	4.123237012445331
Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	3.3851691677420526
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	3.6797664204881038
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	4.452380380969742
It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.	4.243460405110831
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.	4.087827519424612
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	4.078001296056678
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	4.082843528983349
I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept.	3.5103537454878477
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	4.246680931831678
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety.	3.177552463973632
Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas.	5.197148759338943
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.	5.012154105718906
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	4.128951806341994
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	5.047286659328977
We are, for example, still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize. The recommendation for this dates from 1996.	3.5868571680345407
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	4.085428795587256
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies.	3.526950252195362
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	4.038390507956412
The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.	4.4213277414417504
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	3.0893204862499033
So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster.	3.9381619677565465
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	3.052294382355355
Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.	3.3891734039032104
Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.	3.3831600405836992
In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman ' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.	3.775476973931921
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.	2.214146322810486
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	4.059062370483606
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you.	3.4622040299659
But seriously.	6.239866309108056
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders.	3.991057736593825
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.	4.467984420119455
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	4.191197087424409
In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat.	4.048617047507673
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.	3.593641327150491
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference.	4.884885391203404
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us. We must completely overhaul, modernise or, if you prefer, update this policy in its entirety.	3.5065978658871626
If you look carefully, this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets.	2.7784407822716295
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	3.955439420456398
A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden.	3.9067450798551344
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	2.9793407776160357
Resolution on the Commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	2.2817459392296553
Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines.	4.03636818810513
I naturally hope that the result of today ' s vote will be a good one.	7.34478556867371
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	3.0273328316001074
In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware.	3.9047531078758317
It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health.	3.885023140652609
One example is the use of peat.	4.16054203474915
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	4.2821564758570005
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.	5.529278903279343
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.	4.278482820883519
The other area of conflict is more difficult.	3.563807962133522
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups.	4.440755675591249
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	4.611229953241381
Nevertheless, to avoid the customary circus, which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council, maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years.	3.692069939660264
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	3.0981051914243793
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	4.296623396927358
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war, when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists, still goose-stepping, the party of the Waffen SS.	3.514095514007687
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!	4.447224379111245
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	3.687704945766955
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.6488263573675483
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes.	3.685615196556972
Things could well continue in the same way.	2.2761565817616467
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	4.826461912644276
Even within my group, the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion.	2.5530688332904674
The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.	3.9947971116727308
In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation.	4.634042705200071
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	2.9678313376437297
In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.	4.330955633470618
We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content.	3.677698456620185
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe ' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	3.366118403050323
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	2.498340475148959
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted.	5.108128838182146
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	4.241820073386644
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water.	4.299996624147514
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.	3.9956548575166324
Like the whole of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have therefore voted against the proposal to amend Directive No 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend Directive No 2.	3.467106598701111
This regulation is purely instrumental.	5.546869787331229
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.	3.563076891293884
Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality.	4.069126412260371
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.	4.331811732528917
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.	3.5766369426192517
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	5.175258212874883
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	4.059520466276168
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals, for the provision of cross-border services.	3.7441422961441133
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	4.640227070594564
I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.	4.582005541951704
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved.	4.042497384775707
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed.	7.32032969154546
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.	5.222482973655526
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.	2.726728090303909
In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President ' s position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today ' s Minutes:	4.303021023614909
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	4.238232003196261
This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu.	6.083794970314356
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	4.460044114561832
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	4.416934486647895
The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years.	4.05604220820773
In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant.	4.885530190557675
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.	3.29490159780442
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy ' s internal conflict.	4.000107210163488
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.	2.9057848848050196
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.	4.86925850626875
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality.	3.912806335640849
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission ' s own survey among 3000 European businesses.	4.20005849080983
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	2.195687907518921
The European Union ' s water policy is not starting from zero.	4.036557153789179
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	3.5947658111597476
Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	4.457161793807398
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union ' s ability to match words with action.	3.495070748328066
A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment.	2.865583714620133
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	3.2777789363055487
During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.	3.4362190764049827
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	5.376442267046468
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms.	4.37477769003182
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	5.062189282622821
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.	5.219097760319543
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses.	4.405193757043819
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.	4.0289313741465795
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital?	3.755406541805157
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	4.246783292251877
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	2.4283525912282284
As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study.	4.358992808057555
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice.	5.409496474830284
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.	3.577976240135838
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	4.907858548552404
May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas.	4.42790315543008
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	5.139662164833797
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.	2.9664227041590734
This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.	3.2709440171115443
I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.	3.8516099133907553
Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors ' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services.	4.222326433439097
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy.	4.664463954246858
Madam President, I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that, during the conciliation procedure, I was personally a little disappointed with the Council.	3.8671814123237067
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.	3.8710653079253046
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	3.0912923783577706
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	4.565885191339023
I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.	3.901145157137191
Where does all that leave us this year?	2.890599260168458
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, ELDR and PSE Groups.	4.590543192065005
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.	2.938415464231536
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	4.662550315490101
Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	3.1405465423215526
Both biological and economic information are included.	3.248538997094318
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	4.7985876096758755
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	2.9914488929358938
Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.	4.449815005747531
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	2.5538015724231347
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.	4.5143110088252945
It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.	4.608970628026592
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	4.065174659850918
It should prevent society from splintering.	4.157501916116967
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	3.4315172874807343
In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop.	3.581859619713674
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!	4.171025258453033
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	2.7855902887263806
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed.	4.826234444436359
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.	4.91980967467568
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received.	5.078173008936274
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM.	3.354213626715068
I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water.	3.373468884034878
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade" at all.	3.6744306609432917
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations.	4.905632802657502
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.	4.154355564254568
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?	3.4423051406122847
The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus ' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us.	4.256680934013469
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	3.4085131952234713
FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right.	3.6466518530041068
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services?	3.4569910865631917
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria ' s integration process.	3.9973177518206673
Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe.	3.5034814851831593
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission ' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	4.070245271093527
I do not understand why the power centres of Europe are keeping quiet, letting things pass and, by working with the Russians as if nothing were amiss, giving its support to the government which is waging this war.	3.629141030634429
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	4.854821469286085
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives.	4.138021955780286
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.	4.206394682733831
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events.	3.405778165914862
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" .	4.726520548553418
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.	4.526149844927006
And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary.	5.453286612618681
With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy.	3.8105110217749556
People should no longer be forced to move.	3.4023374904058787
I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect.	4.997095079511279
Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ' .	3.402504841939215
I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.	4.365130301741862
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.	3.7357570944678806
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.	4.152438635733738
Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative.	4.613788473526861
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.	3.7895219422533617
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	4.389505790134789
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital.	5.331296899623844
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia.	2.9110479266262637
Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption.	3.8039195705676514
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	3.1508411335475253
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced	3.7746253368172327
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	4.077060046603945
And do you know why?	4.473313118242206
No, of course not.	3.224243761368603
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.	4.078892018787411
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.	4.775911858516147
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	3.572629097192115
By now, my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice.	4.302905895772634
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	4.669617749240841
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.	3.571372270203317
It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous.	3.4568377309664164
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.	3.814154200111159
These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency ' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets.	4.526836214765575
Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries.	4.40457977777157
Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	4.22423573016453
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	3.5339619965862696
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified.	4.510626814857092
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	5.057462023005549
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	3.3678433152471823
My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.	4.393859249069151
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	4.177126254856475
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves.	4.158148204119795
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.	4.932174484802725
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	3.2656801398155
The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight.	4.187812288317092
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	5.046132831212747
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament ' s more drastic positioning.	5.093293941819691
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	4.72949792540417
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.	3.8394927203181712
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.	4.566610584603272
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them.	3.2161433246872715
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.	4.283558773080778
Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe ' s main fears.	3.780145415861523
As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	4.065946346104111
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control.	3.5877112139937553
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.	6.478007189082959
Our rapporteur ' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded.	4.381377951929372
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.	3.2308275533229103
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines.	5.024031791967419
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	4.937239655795279
As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now.	5.365696832002805
I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service.	3.8666680641601845
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux.	3.9259834148368444
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends.	4.871597853706198
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	4.395329730214526
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.	4.39103993206163
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	4.180381376315157
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application.	4.002533536582327
That is not the sort of postal service that we want.	4.380652919663062
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations.	3.7197418155888795
It would be appropriate, however, for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences.	4.334005028135815
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties.	5.045773574489202
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country.	3.9383582566977395
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.	3.9063374383528253
.	1.3940351656188106
In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner ' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres.	4.19791873079193
At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future.	3.7156491740392648
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region.	3.5766580533317613
We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent.	4.005175402803925
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	3.4121282127853134
Questions to Mr Barnier	2.6725169526702173
The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector.	4.396817676389918
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse.	3.4416597254052976
For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption.	3.9071442801117278
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.	4.512349419721703
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	2.989715186594429
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts.	3.2402848078991524
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.	3.6851980820152224
You must go further, towards reconciling the people with Europe, in particular those people who are falling victim to economic, social and, probably, in the future, technological divisions.	4.025866970829288
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey 's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	3.9852816919223044
We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair and considerate use of water.	3.9876636222635655
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	3.5165293135267492
Mr President, 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council.	3.77657990608464
Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself.	4.026142787853593
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.	3.5154378352570936
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.	3.733297052743183
In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy.	4.034366833072536
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	3.455238412152861
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone.	3.9211142337089546
Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied?	4.179158469940399
Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit.	3.62948270991372
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	4.227957664518521
The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community.	3.2002504724853287
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.	3.8565833277720354
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal:	5.5673059801242815
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe.	4.279448552211282
Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe.	3.689271362490359
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	5.018679564426749
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	4.306102865802223
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	3.3846434954424267
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.	3.243260045188942
For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation.	3.3798376611405665
Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism, sanctions and are even brought to trial, such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced.	2.4757362701198518
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	4.396660574323427
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union.	2.9189307585170914
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment.	3.509138121270164
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	4.834065558605211
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	3.4420132391987854
Consistency and action are needed.	2.068434289898629
As you can understand, it would be easy to do so.	3.7333154296632665
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	3.506820071089376
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	3.928136017917324
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange.	5.594076946431308
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.	5.177988956448195
- (ES) Mr President, I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party which I represent on this issue.	3.3670515528844818
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.	4.8452320079471685
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	4.444359556911864
This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place.	4.949490696669885
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.	3.295601312668385
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.	2.5183050945979253
Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States.	5.03506265462762
What is the basis of armed action?	4.1934701087683655
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members ' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	5.0455880017688814
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.	4.778696100925767
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama ' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	4.233175361353742
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.	3.7189749331348265
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues.	4.5394664558341065
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	3.8942416619913676
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament ' s motions are anything to go by.	5.258743817439889
It is certainly not my task to judge other people ' s alliances but if the People ' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people ' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.	3.3088815026147755
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	4.421838094222345
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned.	3.585753772374954
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	3.890037784245744
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	4.043386623883719
Press freedom in Angola	2.3607797438862597
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	5.089170887420563
Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.	4.2456308652741654
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union.	4.121147328377197
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	4.4708176572923914
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	3.5863228898372403
I also welcome the Commission 's communication.	5.198118021874509
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.	4.255465295169539
The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water.	4.266547357567584
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	4.785021611116594
Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding.	3.315439177549382
However, forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me.	4.365674341491197
B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	2.188111195894188
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos.	3.220264943795951
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.	2.918839217375437
As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit.	3.388343582651444
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts.	2.7053074580984773
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	4.9349020397497565
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten 's report.	3.480721182894416
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies.	3.4694201893040173
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	5.346089304337006
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.	4.066811188117685
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned.	3.883898391913659
My group 's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group 's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	3.600377988384503
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies.	3.395161105213629
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	4.1795582675482565
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	3.1420793568975967
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	4.423540219679681
With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.	4.267799103224449
Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well.	4.706238870185854
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	3.4703762138064294
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	4.30095390549568
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.	3.7964074957832006
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?	3.2411001966584054
However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business.	3.807180399951256
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	4.798557573376508
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.	3.861372227311857
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar ' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	4.084807137966862
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently.	3.510342804436864
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe ' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all.	3.894359914894721
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it.	4.545433807539145
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.	3.158327863834406
Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services.	3.121663189942402
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	3.7983104008951227
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	2.8923610030830096
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.	3.3859005876968626
And the merit of Mr Corrie ' s report is that it highlights the value of this original, proactive development instrument, together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly.	3.805585448798855
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations.	3.8142857148510196
Will it be omitted?	3.401924149290555
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.	3.7398781238143632
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials ' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	4.02730002879852
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can.	3.514169137882041
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	4.460998743706856
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284.	3.6465887979278766
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	3.600053504484617
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.	3.534042749697174
They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin.	3.140722351891701
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe.	2.826757950477439
Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice.	3.7442160607998165
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week ' s debate.	4.06078210759908
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	4.162508281037463
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence.	3.235443552867744
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2472483132960324
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	3.991130267446866
Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable.	5.348441445521834
In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party, the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success.	3.3434099145301643
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.	4.1308337745491155
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	4.397426962227294
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties.	4.60258463388601
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament ' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.	3.7104325491251395
Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage.	3.6028517813930336
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.8840611680037562
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	4.385770201589146
There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk.	4.333003888414971
Mr President, it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission, and I will refer to this later on.	5.034367237523357
The first country is Indonesia.	5.357962435529112
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	4.07724034802292
That concludes the debate.	1.9556947861217602
Legal security requires this.	2.605617955852374
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	5.078467882123478
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	3.8639367273517475
The FPÖ party is established in Austria ' s political landscape.	6.348145771287084
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.	4.287825042586234
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	4.0007157520529875
Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.	2.91140165790491
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	4.025836258825131
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	3.6790793407059654
These will take place at a later date.	4.245159994679013
During the previous question, we were discussing electoral issues.	2.833331190211294
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards.	3.282534181571247
It is essential that we get the mix right.	3.7921608943058676
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	4.3950463910545965
These and other specific measures included in my report can, in my view, lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster, in order to promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium-sized firms, particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour.	4.35903009678929
They have our full support.	3.220358246438937
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda, there are already four items.	3.359521812650134
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	4.039424682687391
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation.	4.2007921758684335
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.	5.010653335534031
The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States.	5.05816995380277
Women belong to different social classes.	3.3011407600300027
Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us.	3.8216257449461746
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.	3.173049881005142
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	3.6485469514651414
If not, we will be fighting a running battle.	4.078976608120134
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.	2.8625409210722332
Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left.	3.902811302033188
Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types.	5.3789440796880434
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union ' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	3.7730495903769654
Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.	3.8698585574689663
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that.	3.29801445970189
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers ' needs continues.	3.6717106703551194
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.	3.5771397494652906
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.	2.909903324172777
VOTE	1.083590840144401
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	5.9964653141947
There is nothing new in your work programme.	3.3039736708982077
Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement.	3.0985523103012933
But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget.	4.796536313822035
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house.	3.6992733097380506
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	4.401379095809665
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	3.3025777216168395
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer.	2.936092116203575
The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind.	3.5708812546791995
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	3.392066657145587
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.	3.0782106780276806
Let us grab our chance.	2.8748755370798627
This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is.	4.357099554206285
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	3.845780346634476
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	2.605701714767209
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?	4.06035603790454
Just a few main points.	2.2785302254425503
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	3.9198671089121904
And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow.	3.2672775440594832
Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions.	3.0838357302009163
The Commission ' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts.	5.322912082945492
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):	2.7942409779660218
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.	3.4533324073042193
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	3.334852313294346
Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	3.4837050323893886
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	3.4770088347923913
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	4.57340304309874
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.	5.676487566062792
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	4.147955372256826
I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel.	4.4114781103931735
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	3.890091371146798
Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully.	4.02729952424379
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.	3.563724536174157
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House, Mr President, I should like to make a clarification.	4.22298307635719
More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well.	2.876739415008469
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law.	4.725544539697854
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.	3.3253303167333663
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union.	4.291133755112159
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	5.158079200196498
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion.	3.900863638631287
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	4.897953429001911
I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions.	3.718708455202207
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	3.450518710094456
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	4.49538840226843
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.	3.101352276297467
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	3.139993651444088
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	4.851955820270129
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.	3.6849541543044646
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	4.481096927495278
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic.	4.386684792838112
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity.	4.856376300148739
That is what Culture 2000 represents.	2.7319722002163984
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	3.882103191767771
It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously.	3.3218534338612757
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process.	4.141326979492146
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	4.752595136841608
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	3.94829279803589
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	4.047766901944603
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	4.322456582906992
We must do this for the sake of the environment.	3.3756814632429366
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	5.433972012264243
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners.	4.576930394480723
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	4.487673690792544
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.	3.7102148483665793
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.	4.22187128031064
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented.	3.4622361404768083
In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character.	4.54952921208438
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.	3.1829695043357975
Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level.	3.009809030422082
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	2.8524678442027613
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.	3.9971617993576407
The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties.	3.977657299982376
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.7729642561226249
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.	4.5843989214639045
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	5.06118222706594
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States ' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	4.828239189128188
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	4.550709002994913
They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital.	3.076211263091956
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.	5.27013864362036
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers.	5.431094387828054
Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years.	3.3592365930332875
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.	3.6331795996073875
Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years.	2.9214060560234283
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	3.2953666390080674
(Parliament approved the joint text)	1.5688564067660473
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	3.9531363800701067
However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted.	4.272662349749404
I am very concerned about these translation problems which, unfortunately, we seem to be having increasingly, and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed.	4.051263184550016
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	4.560738386102449
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.	3.8268433152045076
We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired.	4.03588609146039
I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste.	6.489511133559784
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):	2.4407936391534335
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	3.943550666684522
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	3.897651674563232
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba ' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	3.7949598236676696
It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks.	3.139000787283086
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.	3.8014199963526707
We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.	3.556755181243886
The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.	3.7971079323810826
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	2.775959321214428
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.	4.1634963212802365
Is that the message we want to send out?	5.457759443940461
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.	4.745961599758111
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year?	3.3265657960998776
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period.	6.04154700582411
Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management.	4.4140588202863515
In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side.	4.88135443738993
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	3.8424803816251836
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):	2.8006966272636644
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.	4.5150597042124465
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	3.8036370555494834
I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned.	5.030322213653848
It is also a matter of conviction.	5.61790786199945
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	2.9114713606606295
In the meantime, let us support this first step.	3.742400043401751
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.	5.456539430575086
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	2.667418333429582
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy.	3.7050708210273244
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	4.661688170848644
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	3.1780068722995085
- (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately.	3.9686946908668457
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	3.7850558238733143
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002.	3.6082350324781904
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.	3.867251800021452
We stand ready to do so.	3.5693312518649374
., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	3.3364707164646346
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	4.538531284289049
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s reign of terror.	4.417319847046815
The main point is that the money for Cyprus ' s and Malta ' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December.	4.754907798676734
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	3.4989643714600014
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement.	3.521524458066992
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	3.9981564427076797
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom.	3.3816658546653695
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	3.6339257104901357
The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.	2.3540242356375347
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	5.616931374787378
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.	2.76276567081425
The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects.	3.833341565571153
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this.	4.157473933967862
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	3.3957401478869826
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	5.406899294962058
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes, in the Agriculture Council, the Health Council, the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council.	4.124578398558405
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	3.983764506952662
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.	3.4402890574026137
Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.	3.249884791303818
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	1.9851691530262678
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	4.691540163539507
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF ' s work your full support, also in its present form.	3.6126443447637686
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about.	4.850937032093891
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004.	5.904442353065428
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	3.5412848491003843
It must be visible.	2.788449024037351
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union ' s regional policy in general.	3.5385551347377033
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.	3.480696414039933
In these areas, Europe ' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.	4.079897775263327
In short, the issue is an important one.	4.651013381470287
Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out.	3.6845383474250237
This I think is the new Convention.	6.173725114253634
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.	3.848650218379152
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.	4.527418397941618
So much for the political aspect.	3.3234279823676576
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds.	4.655872981281697
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.	4.3826149123789575
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	3.261634981094454
It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.	3.75879129783289
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	4.867470478396656
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily.	4.557396545982617
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.	4.193456185616439
In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation.	4.372988887731108
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control.	3.907795786661783
I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution.	3.5460749294953704
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	3.734066098714123
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	5.8732413442338025
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	3.314014806221978
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom, security and justice.	3.8446449480318843
Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible.	4.0336542211315605
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	3.647630243526548
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.	5.488127081840663
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	3.151900101081352
However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested.	4.349810448735792
In 1910, a woman ' s right to vote was on the agenda.	3.393507878771864
The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails.	4.322512747816355
.	1.3940351656188106
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	4.486086459804672
We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.	4.463426163084764
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	4.7969236900299315
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	3.7605587648793977
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say.	2.974260867903744
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	5.016523774796315
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	4.532088049734745
Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money.	3.1533505884212607
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.	5.025267357367238
And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice?	5.779678892346723
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence.	4.888214950078768
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	4.657711587608139
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	4.729975785963949
It is a very extensive report.	4.767097784412513
I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by ' be replaced with 'dealt with ' throughout Amendment No 37.	3.4312201889160767
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	3.898545843130463
However, we should look a little more closely at some points.	4.293521887099125
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	3.690978021289244
Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.	4.533417079662195
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	2.9420369376360873
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.	4.344561231133402
In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective.	3.85506449031059
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.	3.2347744846994417
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	4.642685918500376
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.	4.6933561999538735
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.	4.979398398756101
In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation.	3.8883095941077177
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track.	3.519359278101964
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	4.308401215291035
The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness.	4.4808602426993485
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda ' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.	4.530013518161549
If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.	4.486306847206342
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	2.223119738560122
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive.	4.615464404776979
We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament ' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.	4.044544048559164
I have for many years, in word and deed, been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia. However, recent events - firstly, what were really threats by the Council of Ministers, then Mr Prodi ' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and, finally, the present decision - are things I cannot support.	3.438028608273104
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	3.9342784791335013
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi ' s fault.	3.9848885934735727
In terms of comitology, Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part, insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned.	3.581087923041838
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?	4.578253019523599
For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wakes until midnight - he has checked the TV screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing.	3.077503695186775
- (SV) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing, to say the least.	2.7251728214070403
We cannot afford to wait.	3.919518784263447
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.	5.12116342089566
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.	3.853743143308329
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	3.2808020267019726
Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments.	4.372380818632123
The figure is now 5.35%.	6.576226654733049
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	4.227571789420525
You have to admit: this is a joke.	4.568653025930919
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	3.381131041298051
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters.	5.036443961711031
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.	3.7173348734810214
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	4.1447592619251
Fifthly, to publish an annual scientific, technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out.	2.7536853442317666
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	4.170687592149539
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	3.69706083418887
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	3.9767360426997516
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.	4.272702027390511
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation ' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.	3.968424219096663
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.	4.295420675293329
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	3.481670309593538
Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.	3.2948997507606665
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	5.358976872069743
The question is: who prosecutes?	5.385765006283827

Europe ' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia, the Far East and America.	2.9528803784804443
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way.	3.5663743043060263
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.	2.9552629126583048
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider ' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	3.623680304312643
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.	3.614970063465954
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	2.819772003065479
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	4.343565653662145
Now, finally, the EU ' s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget.	4.473093668841809
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	4.590190023510853
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam ' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.	3.1166577744090325
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.	3.7051746846480533
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe.	2.90307429114202
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	3.8329549472717006
"On 17 February, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, received as guests, at their request, the representatives of the Forum d ' Ermua.	3.418658112603861
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.	3.6339361982740606
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.	4.07486042694562
First of all, the policy comes too late.	2.4311631554841906
In Zambia 25% of teachers have died of AIDS.	4.10887175943903
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	4.075517826406064
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	3.64520772883409
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders).	3.3548563624982752
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	3.5305094660395255
In order to function, the market needs rules.	3.325004645614701
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	4.326758633298487
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union ' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	3.431743292980154
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.	3.6296921344339443
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year ' s work programme.	3.787499308030055
It is not the European Parliament ' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union ' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	4.564335452130649
A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative.	3.6224150351757123
But at this stage I should like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and taken from practice.	4.941679335728158
Such transactions, according to the argument, bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables. This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir.	3.61316010373782
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	2.9835067669383224
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.	4.016922413088002
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon.	3.9170379586458988
For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report.	3.5188280305539665
These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care.	4.42757534396093
We support that.	6.161422819840779
And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health.	3.065382438180111
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	3.590838333329171
Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau.	2.9971675289133284
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.	2.3943527012013597
The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	4.064082654360403
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	5.299104728424008
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	4.685942934590053
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	4.142950314501232
I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada.	3.044959639236863
The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme.	4.1577225865944145
It concerns the next IGC.	4.113849356716215
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	4.5363563339063955
The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means.	3.3579197474183204
This first step is so important because of this model function.	5.612578432927478
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing.	2.3895284353945607
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.	4.521329543203213
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway.	3.376974260325696
Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.	2.672654269215814
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set.	3.5120788722608047
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level.	2.7637336750988895
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points.	4.361878250857848
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is.	3.995449564783991
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.	5.200830373692617
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves.	3.58764789707725
That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old.	3.5168835201223074
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	4.436071642581258
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	3.385399167041046
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	4.686649652495999
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	3.0846459442112186
After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries?	2.9677861964167964
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.	4.318522675711929
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	4.087529991303761
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole.	3.2809025551109174
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.	5.523697782787773
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	4.023098702668364
What do we expect from a government in any case?	3.4586922713582733
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600.	4.671349246166946

An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.	4.093573922192526
Agriculture and health: we see the issue differently from the Commission: in our view there are no consumers: there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health, quality and respect for the environment.	3.5574902379315856
Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	3.2100076083149385
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union ' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	4.040344048093547
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.	4.345449794540527
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	4.2522809935357255
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	3.029798671376967
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	4.24052453943478
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads ' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	3.6838241002649204
Madam President, I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease.	5.1927978203656
This means that we move away from shredding.	4.413158902471123
Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion.	2.823358823472161
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States.	3.3866545167880626
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	3.176819529026818
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries.	3.3342941236993586

Are you going to interfere with Great Britain ' s Parliament if we are elected?	3.604011319604779
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	2.623964250119699
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	4.383439998345424
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	3.6943971642774085

The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic.	3.3769993208251012
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse.	5.20275828834107
This is my main concern in this matter.	3.3031463136257933
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	2.8992225680386676
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.	5.473605721325224
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.	4.6756926277528
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?	4.000148927805469

It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.	3.9941972324774775
We need to take this responsibility seriously.	6.573990062748515
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.	3.4470900637931146
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.	3.6460465369437
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party ' s summit meeting.	3.5945551166454845
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	4.725692170738307
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.	3.497098892306859
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme.	4.328561062726181

The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively.	3.9875921516805715
There must be flexibility.	3.4305087037437905
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	3.4204776554018914
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.	5.044531514164667
So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance.	3.589360812577172
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions when, from what the speakers have said in this Parliament, from all sides of the House, there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta.	4.196207797868194
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.	4.196973085974311
Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries.	4.335344364555266
Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis.	4.417896359654579
The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed.	4.672658351858387
Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union ' s existence.	5.3188866429511465
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi ' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider ' s Freedom Party.	3.6121005114569398
Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands.	3.903011526046535
Excesses are no longer the exception, they have unfortunately become the rule.	2.734647354704805
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	4.883399949924432
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	4.655388321532857
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form.	4.328004707411474
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	3.279625007770844
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.	3.4113442361972965
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	3.766441599896605
Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year?	2.7683704226607215
I support the enlargement of the European Union.	3.6647982169795466
We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market.	4.10530637301641
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside ' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside ' s basic social and economic branch.	3.751236986727839
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.	3.7396808591130957
There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources.	4.299272700762533
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.	3.7271908250294965
It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.	3.7218605892693937
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty.	2.813657083032262
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.	3.716250267169513
And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to.	3.8262022399211584
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	5.078065180478403
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.	3.727672192437573
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	6.197334468656219
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	5.041632603174219
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment, as well as the transfer of territories.	5.198686410733319
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3811274786686611
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.	3.8148433275814444
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.	4.332915166387718
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.	3.6074536024569035
Mr President, all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds.	3.307452753517227
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	3.4341866161958445
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	4.1946281485004135
That statement could not be much clearer.	5.461625779080853
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.	3.7060125860868802
As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day.	3.667709363241164
Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery.	3.3315994975813252
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward.	4.2863004122961375
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.	2.938895314806356
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission ' s original proposal.	4.365941225278488
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.	4.0916191325488045
Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union.	4.053675801290231
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	3.9243265431646206
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	5.380214569355953
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	4.5561980646015865
If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more.	4.821268537008649
The objective is of course to create, first and foremost, a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified.	4.655889546196945
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.	5.374669899347745
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	2.72112428124104
To conclude, the next five years will be crucial.	3.075870983528466
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.	4.350797505627442
In particular, we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission ' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do (see, for example, paragraph 7).	4.232906060246149
But there is an art to that as well.	3.352707761401014
Not at all.	3.093768498591947
In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.	3.5943249030632325
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack ' s very emotionally-charged contribution.	3.3162055394283283
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6283050878427754
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	5.594404149891524
Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven.	3.7883627886782567
In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements.	3.321285034040671
Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation.	3.5675663928589048
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	3.88139475953944
We have tried to drive this proposal through.	3.5257943169508437
Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.	5.360082609142574
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.	4.607782385110862
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed.	3.548725308549291
Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment.	2.291470418442593
I think that this will be problematic.	4.196556416940803
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens.	3.7960767348654163
Second part	2.507521159621085
Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary.	4.230449413652212
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	5.01015376252218
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	4.1948834153689125
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	4.098752072325385
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.	2.820219942478928
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	3.584944893006649
This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme.	4.0271149098766275
This means putting forward the Commission ' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	4.292331984074069
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	3.204402198023711
And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development.	4.311244363093235
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.	4.916571857163401
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty.	3.656872826262709
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime.	3.510013708608998
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.	4.577502180980046
However, Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats.	3.2296860149367426
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.	4.228393004124638
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on.	4.807119851592293
I did not hide behind any immunity.	4.458580407897456
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission ' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.	4.758066090142445
Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe.	3.367042752443832
For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom.	4.032571630944609
Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked.	3.594462910420983
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims ' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	3.8471556818227617
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union.	4.815973646013169
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	3.7403856909016797
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	4.948791943166775
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.	3.0205792696114697
Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs.	4.044969462698045
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.	3.3029834103269167
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.	4.006319506669966
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee.	3.8441115597609046
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.	4.233388597945435
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	4.023812181390177
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	4.283792851217605
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.	3.7275562866498704
Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.	4.657776925578633
Quite, we agree absolutely.	2.785633515329562
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.	4.267862831883832
Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors.	3.7281388091731817
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE.	4.213821785464807
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too.	4.665067481696875
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.	3.645490579732039
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.	4.2220570096385055
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	2.478202889376595
However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation.	4.835588678903791
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	4.27720200540058
It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974.	3.2246338909613153
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.	4.057078508729619
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	3.6361845534104784
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union.	3.876924587855116
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.	3.4393537341151785
Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence.	3.5458759883214683
The President-in-Office informed our committee that the current Portuguese presidency intended the CFP to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources. This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world.	4.1714509252781555
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach.	4.262552138253531
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	2.9362840011463915
I am, moreover, proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council.	4.07800113822154
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	4.673796710971104
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.	3.9858505332051477
The Commission, in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission.	3.871741059793259
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	2.970615015432358
Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council ' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force.	4.243777797101044
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.	4.942731911271152
This precedent, created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned.	5.0987606575787785
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	5.671849760621432
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.	2.740360355408305
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now, part of its very essence, its heart and soul.	4.683182355988115
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group.	3.765250694650403
Given this context, I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago.	3.474850471613126
I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy.	4.008170445108712
However, I would just like to add the following.	4.027691476524412
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.	3.8009004569689666
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.	5.527012382804808
80% of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region.	3.2389116032412515
People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system.	4.429844520693422
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	4.874319238567592
We all, throughout the European institutions - in Parliament, the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years.	5.04981951548947
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	4.336817880927258
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board.	4.13233047047191
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	3.2197233306068385
In particular, we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue, and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage. This naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context.	4.008738943265926
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	3.6759761827695923
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one.	5.17287488742776
What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action.	3.8807004881546203
Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance.	2.84497325431317
First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle.	3.285435181399815
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate.	3.9917425986354953
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy.	3.935920444349618
.	1.3940351656188106
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention.	4.57390921697234
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre.	3.6884355362695005
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy.	3.983662839794074
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	3.1076119738991714
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	4.396774155885854
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.	4.5508488207384055
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.	5.411305423947868
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.	2.78377340023089
Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i 's left for me to dot.	5.746954874498865
Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.	3.4304430083229436
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.	5.205102381232876
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	3.1634502837546044
Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes.	3.9858457958567888
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.	4.703749578899623
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	3.775340083114662
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	3.4383443694674427
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.	4.673950402177075
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.	3.65101382324949
But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.	3.605945597758833
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid.	5.4006811056168305
Not to use women ' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.	3.638254516806216
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	4.541120768371873
-	2.2318028971929302
In its present form, the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets, in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them.	4.4600085933368225
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit.	3.6564777796664263
I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft" .	3.34898527232693
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	2.2575361676006387
First of all, civil society.	2.134980634797723
Stand by universality and affordability!	2.386095759145433
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN).	3.5071564469264622
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)	2.804822559015922
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	4.451215430147039
Mr Rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.	6.341340085145312
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?	7.172705679550809
This too has not been solved.	6.829661987065933
Human rights	2.2361132486835533
In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater.	3.800443035827148
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	3.766817392322602
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	4.164877497267671
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.	3.8003746733045847
The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive.	3.751770809817953
If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets ' suspicion of the euro.	3.206240586097491
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.	4.537988054780589
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	3.454544349825922
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	3.462336213332024
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	4.649721099311192
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.	5.085788774573435
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	3.607504874082499
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	2.4799877583306986
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	3.723421473383866
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	3.2345388032740368
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	3.668343764714533
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives.	2.908492556041523
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	3.9331840084136918
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.	3.077357277154929
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal ' s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position.	4.085463412420933
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.	4.296163951315997
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up.	3.778625305197785
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.	3.2024329521488273
It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia.	3.441680350568993
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	3.952165369534242
Parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	4.350839614652861
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	3.428216803298609
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	3.4816251740899644
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.	4.285873946104252
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	4.038658927749638
In particular, the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems, improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment, in the graded management of coastal areas, improved training, information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management.	3.099442680203854
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable.	5.4317711724159725
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.	3.8480256917958857
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	3.79604001602661
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.	3.043788197708412
The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido.	6.114405934171738
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	6.031223803980852
Welcome	1.0963497644087596
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.	4.0614303784839425
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.	4.983746115769074
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	2.947953833579235
Storms in Europe	1.7547875281341174
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues.	4.3834304401099216
It is not only the targeted, specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport.	4.014146568955664
Will they also take part in our defence policy?	3.7991714611899594
My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker.	4.111590094557988
Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion.	5.1949580864081
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.	3.4437460675605895
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.	4.486518153929689
Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report.	4.347623912061505
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.	3.8475038199545035
Macedonia did not go through a war.	3.1545973370773948
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	4.27113152083538
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.	3.909896380224934
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	5.376003546934831
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.	5.093062810610669
At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position.	3.658022916650051
Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday ' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	4.57235642288459
The people of Angola deserve better.	4.326104133099359
Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	2.4831228166478003
We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim.	3.450067116106868
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	3.5069735080272393
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	3.232078331275648
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	3.624176065897575
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor ' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	4.310073597628422
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.	4.235343787860543
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year.	4.703142461211442
Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission ' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses.	3.5565631039869143
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union ' s credibility.	3.4527158687407757
It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.	4.1988344738039265
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.	3.94842605981789
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	3.4444133272757433
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.	3.144642593701238
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.	4.542650699054393
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other.	4.247825388561221
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.	4.717261767344653
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid.	5.716093146506898
Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.	3.55702965616745
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address.	3.375244812337648
We say that we want to protect human rights.	6.525946031780187
These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.	3.726539971404092
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	2.8690418850646813
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.	4.87027145571589
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	3.8032144241692785
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.	3.4097565421649296
In other words, when EU commercial interests are concerned, poverty considerations go out of the window.	3.602612953443115
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"	3.672415350372889
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	2.864299921970196
In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions.	3.2320235578135246
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical.	5.4224217914228
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.	2.913791160281768
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	4.072372869259589
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission ' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	4.25134256629382
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.	4.4603107659389405
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.	4.050894948271873
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States.	3.596704118519358
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	2.727165729885335
So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented.	4.575033108285263
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	3.733245125672938
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation.	5.848636526916014
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	3.7617914299147617
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	2.4813058311664653
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure.	5.031460510212993
The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes.	5.7179973800548805
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.	3.4685511726162788
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors ' meeting on Wednesday.	3.918669070078
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	3.5272360062342827
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people ' s quality of life.	3.3461300312756497
The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems, which are not touched, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty.	4.834443414197105
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	3.4805755259206204
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	4.15043635890648
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority.	2.773728010693934
Let me explain.	3.322760365840955
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.	4.916875146900894
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.	4.766253278653843
The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus.	3.4757820171834743
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor ' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	4.166865848765673
Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British.	4.0556710002413325
Unfortunately, very little.	3.717386254443007
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	4.935331569350431
Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever.	2.7919816574493206
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services.	4.701235011136204
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	4.349864367265659
It is a fact that the road has been a long one, mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property.	4.39007115682586
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	3.8137121445664794
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome.	4.3095017206521975
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.	4.284593190085428
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.	3.0230442370249015
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution.	3.8865366688580045
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	4.3714478513451835
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature.	4.229532923651942
It is extremely important.	3.398312169168837
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state.	4.109932968430791
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.	2.55723884570085
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union.	3.7048844673036245
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does?	3.535541929813605
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution.	4.758317652359499
It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment.	4.062541320782568
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one ' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?	3.9574370927025537
I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein ' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council.	4.83276406912256
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid.	3.7696965735517867
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries.	5.742679481430282
But we must support our tourism!	4.037867496872138
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.	3.2656829451390097
However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions.	4.467929567611861
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.	3.890714551813627
.	1.3940351656188106
However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission 's insistence.	4.028993345787237
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament ' s opinion is.	4.833305823187589
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament ' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.	4.121566211257707
The European Commission ' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.	4.51561508008814
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	4.035924643778199
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	2.6723872988978457
For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.	3.970709627567805
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.	2.454657733955729
Both parties were once part of the government.	4.080483798173194
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables.	3.9384480302899556
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.	5.062678255274141
There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand.	3.186896483999228
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.	4.989988994323644
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	3.8297370291051114
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue.	3.7057047855567506
In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one.	3.8256828419634483
They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	5.409339193939969
Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.	3.7371689766895844
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution.	4.086757768674591
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.	4.985890691283813
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	4.066017664948865
My second criticism follows on from the first.	3.645596083109902
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	3.2355897364082855
In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS.	4.089273243596578
I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised.	4.060493341109123
In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments ' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.	3.3460222526181
This leaves it wide open to abuse.	4.833106184143613
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43.	6.787375549507414
We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations.	4.381044518733969
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	3.737447257787972
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature.	6.080185825036875
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.	3.3558675584572226
Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report.	4.039714729103723
Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything.	2.6381510796820216
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	4.090796656982479
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	3.494419301915674
I also want to mention the death penalty.	3.394935362304792
Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries.	2.8286449208144497
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.	4.494031620121177
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes.	4.983458477239856
It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately.	3.983265609043941
I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.	4.364930159385936
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	3.1434170338617355
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock ' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	4.988238494043917
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	4.606845853780631
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	3.524276799365132
I agree with Parliament that the common position ' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced.	4.152556430294563
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind.	5.22596852461078
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.	3.9232735824470675
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	4.281030490014076
However, that is not the problem.	5.134863309030928
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda.	4.722040839720954
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter.	3.0548831646094095
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	3.4761199886755176
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done.	4.87861584465057
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny.	3.6806654133055123
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.	5.672023319176494
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	2.1670807508318797
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.	3.727554902539461
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.777368865123436
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency.	3.0825400780100005
Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly.	4.5770176268285105
But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind.	3.910071836243172
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.	4.337607488995362
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	3.463061257449178
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	4.83458226590217
- (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.	3.533515450931815
It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court.	4.8603821709548125
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.	4.11016102280673
While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun, I think it is important to keep the two processes apart.	3.7331617776796326
As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts.	3.4844085880090816
We need to cooperate with the Council too.	4.655102143219962
However, we must be realistic.	3.7526413353992782
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade.	2.7700301464353303
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop.	3.048124298731631
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator.	3.11879276144723
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	5.018166415608441
You can see it in different countries.	3.497824834065413
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	3.412428794095473
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case.	4.482813281142989
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	4.697501164175284
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.	2.771835213994598
I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council.	4.281397121341069
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.	4.134930364265147
It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute.	4.625773759332484
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.	5.206314197811657
In anticipation of this EU directive ' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied.	4.286417413728529
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	3.6087920611264743
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN ' s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967?	3.36558733893487
The time for resolutions has passed.	4.243172107765088
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	2.9292245184020937
So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services.	3.759797951147688
That is not guaranteed.	3.764370928729731
In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia.	3.1051155417952137
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	4.504276512594978
Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles.	6.025057484968454
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	3.5235655245813486
I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty.	3.8887787898389585
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	3.7015528479009037
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	3.8447354388987054
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	3.0630394858949734
WIPO treaty	2.1505307804963403
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	4.347641731422654
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	2.687161734885128
We asked for a whistle-blower ' s regulation, and this is now in place.	5.3974737723089
In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak.	3.0426463945221096
We should salute it - and I think we do.	6.150858863883861
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.	3.4902355268225844
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	3.8961182052888885
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	4.716318366070171
However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security.	5.66962331337668
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	2.845530318394964
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	4.024983863089992
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.	4.516125381826045
Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.	3.7160863211067223
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.	5.476983991799131
Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, José Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another.	3.3497136447642584
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	3.6874883483125354
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission ' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.	4.305472009301928
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	3.0209898621145537
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	3.231951811568913
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	2.9895093792559715
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	4.029632862271317
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	6.683668979572301
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.	4.423519434548491
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!	4.029744672447481
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	3.8580463109747853
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	4.997057490360003
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted.	3.3489705832429135
Disparate actions are not effective.	2.14795921916571
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.	2.5261823596573616
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	4.031250939813778
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	4.507952887924216
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	1.8863810877139062
Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before.	4.487101298900036
We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union ' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.	4.186176598917565
I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules.	3.6836823721795935
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	3.366345781236051
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	3.3692668650903186
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	3.2716686104760977
Second reading of the Florenz report (A5-0006/2000)	3.0542333590749915
We are familiar with Parliament ' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council ' s legal advisers.	6.132052517506678
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.	3.6509995557929447
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity.	4.1168132319628326
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims ' families.	5.560519969748155
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.	5.810979308030681
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	3.7350646386303348
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress.	3.9960489110391757
My second question is of a critical nature.	2.902543616365199
The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council.	4.687742259842901
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict.	4.862417352826619
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	3.7568314193840875
However, I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway, the A32.	3.6636651178494306
It also inspires a few political comments.	4.491074733280542
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):	2.8033942767819666
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	3.992599417186784
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	4.046450570676978
Indeed, for some 'forestry ' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.	3.2234378727084985
Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand.	3.3048789943777375
Today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.	3.267885060530978
Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire.	2.9244205525730576
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens ' loss of interest.	4.601118378273888
We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote.	3.8997484824323445
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations ' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	4.962746764854488
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good.	4.164719383879316
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.	3.4341141484349285
I, together with the European Parliament ' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council ' s Legal Service, is inappropriate.	4.310668535203929
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision.	4.466536302326206
I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.	6.194753970796327
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	3.8832578174800108
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	3.5152331880978696
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.	4.189060976856475
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.	1.8407975862310226
At any rate, the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union.	3.917040254161842
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these.	4.38844278549448
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):	2.926109730353238
We have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones.	4.101027147095896
I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions.	4.0160892081687125
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	4.692219151811167
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.	4.490290869248822
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.	4.250099678573324
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?	3.3340975314508703
We are taking legal advice.	4.509603885326991
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union.	4.6362529108352435
They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	4.599528246846821
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	3.5890522274566434
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	3.4880007281184247
And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community.	3.9083379534010234
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	3.316543870541796
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing.	4.911000613461759
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	5.046615827513673
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.8840611680037562
No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself.	5.435468760750135
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	3.838140311915548
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE.	3.6750023577534003
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	3.9179941675482612
Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.	3.837120946918471
What has been done about training?	5.204495523394869
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions ' way of working.	3.6427248261695455
Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources.	4.180501071480543
At present, the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security.	3.6734341523577547
. (FR) We are disappointed by the Council ' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive.	4.540889605906263
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations.	3.795746829885313
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.	4.4583583082615315
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.	3.2207095316130636
The Commission guideline document for the new structural fund ' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises.	4.294240694561774
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.	4.026465094822841
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work.	3.3677622514596184
I also welcome the White Paper.	3.237769339557478
(Loud applause)	1.0387039174734527
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility.	4.99222674008842
However, because of the Council ' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000.	3.994463131047229
- (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	4.492332078951989
And why should we not note that the Commission ' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women ' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?	5.312546116967929
The joint debate is closed.	2.945725866164446
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.	3.3295755544359698
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.	3.84466741644603
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.	3.827467091658048
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	3.0113397169204874
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	3.296860498147866
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	5.109928112897887
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.	3.0854220006987356
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference.	4.699835209258633
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	3.590423085893127
The delays in the Commission ' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.	4.486403854799409
On the other hand, the new Austrian Government ' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights.	3.4043773173648524
Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees.	3.7188465602483567
Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice ' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.	3.7939650798399462
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	2.73034018120014
It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission.	4.464841925131717
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.	3.242832025022283
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.	4.538344020546507
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	4.157803719398277
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do.	3.9657177838897955
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not.	3.9767948408666665
Report (A5-0069/1999) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999)0101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)	2.2242558101306176
Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world ' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe ' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.	4.750871154903807
We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union ' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey ' s will as regards the European Union ' s priorities in its foreign relations.	4.309569661960519
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle.	3.7738414754909617
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	5.8497554250155845
My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade.	2.844109354465147
Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups.	4.4096716013792605
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?	4.0019156400049996
The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports.	3.808355439018238
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent.	2.607688581248782
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first.	4.615680324713278
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.	4.286436245589936
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.	5.5461923782601
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	4.376713737560834
We are looking for solutions.	5.951229882161588
In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.	3.087254275391738
A company is pilloried one day and not the next.	4.3953635105067335
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	3.911501303238211
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.	4.114010113146865
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.864250087561804
My group is fully intent on helping with this work.	2.771531298373202
That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council.	3.4556161174497624
We can take action against this; it is possible.	4.001697020817601
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.	4.477408560149103
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	4.602208789332107
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way.	3.400486140452818
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	4.116165483236763
It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament ' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.	4.823412640591446
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States ' parliaments.	4.447399839943047
I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers ' view that this is such an interesting debate.	4.125465182778092
The Austrian People ' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	4.438068848783796
.	1.3940351656188106
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe ' s development process.	5.6465185751499645
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.	3.0574815567038955
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	3.3254309069374552
The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)].	2.619297481591174
This discussion is not new.	4.640224750197191
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.	6.172596263233273
That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.	3.8904810492600617
This is what we need for ships.	4.382005628274755
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	5.037183631486266
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	3.3540654516602766
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):	2.4407936391534335
Subject: Commission 's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	3.2991800506168665
We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments.	3.6395089182315914
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.	3.8960837271395556
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	3.5542794278759775
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR.	3.554118244590736
Employers would be lost without immigrants.	2.1772970303155823
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome.	4.944694811845701
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell.	3.956244938110846
The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria.	3.9269213574907726
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.	4.633073251780908
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	3.967656787461933
With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another.	3.266582144217626
Mr President, the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union.	4.310484830285787
One example is water transfers.	2.6944840448397622
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	3.910279193888513
This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general.	4.977931969944039
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us.	4.651741249018533
We believe in 'one man, one vote ' more than 'one share, one vote ' .	3.028272471051679
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?	3.4431373058320562
Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible.	4.275959513253241
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?	2.2862249301518656
Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do.	3.588391610876339
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!	5.317478686437412
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.	3.2965798513065443
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions.	4.3609636240926495
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.	2.9319998176957345
We need a framework of regulations at international level.	4.268523743076333
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	5.554183542240956
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	4.122296517385311
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty.	3.8282166377838953
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	3.7709449971539284
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.	3.1995190429245577
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.	4.044390851213092
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	4.073711518694627
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report.	3.560697019869201
It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed.	3.785498096151048
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects.	4.104581332526989
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.	5.785449570965645
This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 7.	5.329479426530585
However, I find these passports inadequate.	3.6546784329002535
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	3.754755844408698
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	3.658659045990331
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.	3.5866563946520333
(PT) The Commission ' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.	4.060762057298027
The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy!	5.180844579840959
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission.	4.299973216527513
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	4.035171170251893
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water.	3.6707115067279465
We are therefore all to blame.	4.047648369598252
Question No 7 by (H-0035/00):	2.926686777255709
The moment of truth is approaching.	5.893262934954484
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before. We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions.	4.373153868234706
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece 's contribution amount to?	4.47023164285615
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days ' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals.	3.028925145084589
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.	3.9134024099076816
Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	2.5325863603519116
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment.	2.9229903816822174
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today.	3.7252432906208846
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	3.5805659816376223
This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future.	5.306770786900565
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	4.748604759437081
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement.	4.6964641036949075
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.	3.391364889939731
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter.	3.0993839333725695
And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.	4.418330690453442
It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner.	4.214762469805745
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk.	2.511949573048669
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.	3.3408391207898904
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.	3.42057354773434
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	5.4327852272714505
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	2.7108708976227405
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round.	4.071252563495811
I should like us to take a leading role in this work.	4.052885538929376
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.	4.261312457883193
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco.	2.8931308940981944
Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure.	3.664728220957885
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be.	2.9760501572876845
Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members.	3.588440610483885
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	4.16975913537499
This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed.	4.224600606177843
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this.	3.2504424123205617
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.	4.381126437019029
As for a ban on certain materials: of course we need one!	4.783622686135452
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	3.977916706140773
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD).	2.408814859826987
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime.	4.287973043404248
No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low.	3.4769286926982375
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said.	3.0040329691087
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Radicals; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberals and Austrian liberals.	3.196505434883779
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO.	5.244291507643519
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars.	3.370131273102015
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF.	3.7362134836151015
How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission ' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees ' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc?	4.648111337809467
In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then.	3.423781695948442
So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not.	3.0160541362957205
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	4.058069975185494
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended	2.7738064638430586
What she has said here is completely justified.	4.4026577228574615
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament ' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine ' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	4.303185822113119
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.	3.3822693250464164
There are different views on this.	3.4900101141249804
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority.	3.953290434546831
It is not just a question of style.	3.6280828400734584
This is a complete revolution of the Commission ' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.	4.451060498661845
It is now February and we are still waiting.	6.030094633544232
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)	1.9451468837011094
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	4.628364559989343
In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves.	3.506954290169344
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.	5.510109868756849
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission.	4.801753071635212
Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union.	3.386836974334079
Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO ' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment.	3.6473499591319443
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.	3.453064891779416
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	3.475329304069341
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.	4.076186453461652
As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken.	5.114762720998718
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	3.6984693637634467
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.	3.2317424737595344
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	4.800460028530525
It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	3.23006820297586
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.	4.609257269886452
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	3.719646440992852
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective.	3.7549883077076083
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result.	3.944308379683655
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.	4.479955767351359
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	3.4563329418058335
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann ' s work on this matter.	3.584282191891933
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	3.6593354245585994
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.	3.154879220109969
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	4.167234157949573
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.	4.168719092357013
The situation is badly managed.	4.687174228830711
The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets.	5.083221956040583
On the common agricultural policy, the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms.	3.4358314523626925
I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President.	2.5653782625509174
Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time.	4.387772430420714
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative.	3.8037611582651634
Whatever Jörg Haider ' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this.	3.541366231793588
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	4.080651499928399
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	5.18418294540452
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	3.954092230551544
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	4.902739091962996
The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America.	3.2684148820778502
Everyone is free to hold such views.	2.2552865226593983
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	4.805468032055139
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities.	3.998149694529604
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	3.156202670463988
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today ' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.	3.666242095783727
In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou ' s proposals.	4.040387151946999
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	3.3318435795587087
These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative, Álvaro de Soto.	3.6936513212906594
For example, you did not go into antibiotics.	4.770875317629884
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	3.8866940377166306
Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000)	2.3321734468627935
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.	4.507498860069761
We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	4.498578017343384
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	3.4259944809240372
Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better.	2.6744382307536076
There are no boundaries for Community policies.	3.2468431068148664
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia.	5.035551827107468
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	3.0584291520464335
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	4.309675072903325
In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel ' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail.	3.5977980959584457
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	4.643713062500546
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.	3.673845634238563
I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination.	4.617790199935486
A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands.	2.93207088031965
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	3.4120846268278893
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	5.1878764622424445
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	3.4520992169993305
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	3.652338021626911
We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction.	4.09125034671646
Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries ' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed.	3.758511139180926
During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity.	3.423143287099376
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason.	3.626371638146853
Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister.	3.124371707549432
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.	3.1423926035143843
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power?	2.900612290775137
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.	4.481365344338017
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health.	5.214948584394114

That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.	3.132873491307598
85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is.	3.64249801486123

The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?	4.073296621240727
First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk.	4.319611815578897
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman 's office.	5.731883259110199

The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.	4.272443298322666
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	3.3159433299340626
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case.	3.1873765665990725

the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)].	2.0413807091654115
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	2.817669062385327
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future.	3.587104633610585

I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	5.029386326422461
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	4.200104382945949
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	4.428129406267999
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market.	3.982564317130608

It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable.	3.6876277265697013
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	3.441050436200421
It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions.	3.2710204187970175

My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma.	3.7897051173062093
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned.	3.2339646342265578
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.	4.533253453626183
These are my three questions.	3.4918741783176546

Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.	5.58737216666855
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin ' s 'anti-terrorist ' operation in Chechnya.	2.2231765804484005
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.	3.654344447287296
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	3.284596102812137
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	2.8104639047201623
Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent.	3.6969597800727585
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics. Because women have to deal with different realities.	3.514265176761451
The Union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom, security and justice was confirmed at Tampere.	3.5673138569155953
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance.	4.59029005195469

Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	2.360165160198696
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	4.3072680857514
In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people ' s suspicions.	3.6460117989714176
However, Mrs Lienemann ' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.	3.722976275614433
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	3.8852251360679566
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.	8.231319718781577
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	3.884058697797063
It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested.	2.7683207459491586
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.	5.514088991761445
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	3.746409931581334
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?	3.98010598980751
Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland.	4.018398902845302
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	3.8465584624616906
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	2.841590108801724
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.	5.734247177000206
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company.	3.9184561933584257
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops.	2.9995844164189425
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?	3.0269875156010166

Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success, or to say, "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation?	2.9848575135634463
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	3.2920288780323332
I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State ' s territory against its will.	3.93976733609708
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.	3.99008081250319
Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government.	3.4707449840000844
What are the Council 's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	2.00705299029187
This is not the Union ' s only contribution.	5.434585107697525
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	4.135191070693859
We adopt legislation in the European Union.	5.062463973254819
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010.	5.084989042291048
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	4.035929197793528
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.	4.0436194841038855
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General.	5.799650804596412
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	2.9189482219051546
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	4.290256965755748
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	4.015931577310856
They have paid already.	3.736460403653022
In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.	2.836924289110652
However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999.	3.97622641522347
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin.	3.929381415202088
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012.	5.227507141511002
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.	3.688127028229065
The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position.	4.401195825218504
I can testify to this remarkable work.	4.105411471218001
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples ' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium.	3.8033084956815646
I do not use those as an excuse.	4.1754449210874816
Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino.	5.668210658560517
However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves.	4.8029507778990075
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.	3.9587643375692028
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	3.6037664582615863
The Commission ' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union.	4.492249376867126
It seems contradictory.	5.816413604259846
There is more to be said on that score.	4.523012461473044
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved.	2.2139632633924347
Yugoslavia ' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.	3.7898863836876537
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions.	2.7888891858203713
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries.	4.696185185275103
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.	3.760156585208367
Europe is a community of law.	3.1427691957481927
Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.	3.502463281745784
As I informed Mr Davies, I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors.	3.4616373806172525
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	4.169448609999272
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)	1.9451468837011094
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.	3.792595918893706
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft.	3.628870217463472
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing.	3.137031618780878
I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised, particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks.	4.42862750775008
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.	3.082611439011813
We belong together, even when there are problems.	4.730789070133623
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace.	4.043323527388562
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	4.469280430277028
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.	4.28344523157501
This is the change we must impose on the Commission ' s action.	4.028650964440919
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	3.456715488363175
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	4.173220644206996
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.	4.115340329182564
Furthermore, on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons, I shall, in the next few days, be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.	4.178855186556253
We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective.	3.7871519337441653
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	3.8476801765038493
We have to remedy that.	4.294960939781286
Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	3.443989498695665
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market.	4.1451652199891775
This is the purpose of these guidelines.	4.340207869559644
What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.	4.51034522363071
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	5.609036123779611
So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review.	5.069911041365767
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.	3.7340264973317403
The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed.	5.0309653087800275
No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit.	4.041695233386554
All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required.	4.0478230102334445
This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution.	3.6509980090467975
It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed.	4.406270615538396
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	4.671011288647124
I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.622740883330233
Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture.	5.027711985977991
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament ' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	3.9900832743249435
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	4.604484765988989
We are talking about us, not Austria.	3.9461967209799544
I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers.	4.636552965071038
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years.	3.906657341993859
The population was not allowed any input.	5.383195367437925
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately.	3.6349384294242433
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard.	3.657675751226579
Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners ' Party, there have been many occasions on which I have stated, at the committee stage, that the European Union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly, and in the measures and rules on pensions, as is already the case, in coordination.	4.10483533909487
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	3.732762666594353
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.	4.155834118140696
The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future.	4.101587860445977
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.	3.477130186750164
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.	3.9074705915594197
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question.	2.6899126310097516
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations.	3.4745277070757807
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.	4.3202337510004565
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures.	4.0869160236462125
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	3.3687608974300107
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	3.1914676042164514
That shows that competition really is working.	4.379931109123189
I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom.	3.9573804887617183
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	3.5456600240210867
On behalf of the TDI Group, I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro ' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe.	3.9769866862965797
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union ' s institutions.	3.8991171359398478
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.	4.533934121222654
Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality.	3.5477248308663842
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	3.8188375515221757
Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF.	3.318009089255663
Have the lessons not been learnt?	2.8688237965721544
Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions.	3.524030655804911
When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.	4.524276655451695
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	4.936568723925869
We need to get into that conciliation position.	3.936093469475836
Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid.	3.8410976522853866
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	3.879326399132525
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	3.706362854211421
Do not listen to the report ' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	3.8755843210931595
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.	3.3890789427940984
This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland.	4.270506215555167
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.	3.8057301823161054
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations.	3.8868688204044113
It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover ' activities, and the interception of telephone calls.	3.032173868858075
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	3.2331394079930753
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.	3.441751416872131
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns.	3.562062948866315
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	4.641590286472769
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground!	3.8817422184509622
Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential.	4.450357616439935
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	4.161086541243188
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	3.5761895969548068
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	4.4107065212744505
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	3.706774619679804
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard ' .	3.845129286779432
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	3.1906549435261713
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.	4.616459805253308
Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use.	4.775981367062679
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.	3.3283697788526903
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.	4.484382175838521
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.	4.152185884061453
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies.	3.323562829597011
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.	3.581462435837204
Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour.	3.813489386342852
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	4.037644707725575
As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation.	4.283108230655041
Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town.	2.2098511708785344
It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management.	3.6291570204437438
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission ' s proposals on this matter.	4.156537698956202
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.	3.7642201431474547
That is why we need transparency.	3.3039525579524405
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	5.144828313922381
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version.	3.6704573890556755
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	3.376225268574431
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney ' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	3.717872829822689
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	4.695195182275603
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	3.222623390363585
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.	4.661622560127805
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers ' and employees ' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.	3.528893483096649
This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States.	3.998263703481728
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	4.443821648163115
Third, there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment.	3.207351512670833
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.	3.673081710490798
We therefore have a number of amendments.	6.270109046157777
The discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments. The first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the European Union and the north of the island, without this necessarily signifying recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level, but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island, if a solution can, in the meantime, be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island.	4.214633331897595
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.	4.693430614336868
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	4.146109468667884
We are able but the rest of the female population is not?	3.936000368213463
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	3.0655494832360897
The cultural programmes launched in years past - Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael - are being replaced by a single programme, Culture 2000, where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor.	4.132916385657841
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	4.226369152548692
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.	3.2539781603067772
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	3.142945657539536
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	3.0813427609863333
Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1. ' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council?	3.6939904601727496
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it.	4.874623248257927
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	3.6995770598955042
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.	4.009831057127601
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	3.902319680242205
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	3.9629855983044076
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	3.6737478710225413
Brussels knows best.	2.4142524242380623
The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº.	3.9689209975137607
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union ' s institutions.	3.4118782953115194
The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians.	5.537285586390432
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.	3.8074126943984457
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	3.8749636106010876
The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market.	4.055645304036757
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.	3.8443064684324413
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union, recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base, with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access, on equal terms, and in which our citizens can have real confidence.	4.1828185715360915
Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives.	3.65839456566998
A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.	4.648091126299112
In connection with this, we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well.	4.26935154015518
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial, because otherwise there can be no development. It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique ' s debts.	3.289503898975592
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	3.7736981203962063
I would be in favour of its doing so.	4.895420233641312
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	3.8149772635301717
Or on Shell?	3.094657377956174
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.	3.647258816131813
We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union.	3.769356583522665
He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.	3.115346641380534
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.	4.460213363921587
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	4.029498131212197
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.	3.665602615801953
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.	5.168708049086231
We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.	4.203508493650705
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.	2.850231738911033
In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally.	5.418586538426073
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier.	4.748511132256219
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses.	3.8073230840526597
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	4.716699596951305
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.	5.119636506428209
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	4.592129351040821
Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier ' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with.	3.744163765837415
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment.	4.374358675806362
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	4.001101055230221
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	5.031797947041505
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	2.3812928923489234
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	3.6243115137025166
Is that really authorised?	3.833283331576587
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.	3.402456443777477
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.	4.411578749017094
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	3.3511314539071027
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	4.8600837297332244
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica.	3.0597866489978607
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	3.6250385140554933
Especially in the southern Member States, the tourist industry is a major source of income.	3.1310296079035504
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.	3.496496631190571
Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided.	3.691577112872838
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	4.10974829304584
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.	4.242929740642633
With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries ' special economic and social limitations.	4.572470264662932
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.	3.363415470450943
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	4.730379379209125
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	2.992586598226458
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	4.293129821376737
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.	4.022688229672152
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist.	3.867942939271992
We congratulate you.	6.9844136693129375
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council.	4.6033569523385935
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	3.6900961327762336
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree.	4.687357518653636
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	3.293589706865783
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	3.434315493486578
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive.	4.594863968025488
The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations.	3.595713653757685
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason.	3.1075604988311407
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique.	4.758181305730526
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0125/2000) by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the UN Commission on human rights	2.685267293336912
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.	3.4079558638349563
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.	3.2111960056305637
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	3.5190279879816204
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden, they are calling for more bureaucracy, for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary ' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee, contrary to several resolutions by Parliament.	3.6438362331985954
That is where we really get into difficulty.	3.707431106513285
The unease is justified.	5.670419425242557
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	3.6826658728725152
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	3.6655696583655892
In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island.	3.7186864112674596
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.	3.1891728046298153
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	4.753249900045851
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	5.113274301929008
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	4.42263584564971
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	4.324112747500764
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	3.7648879290823354
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola.	3.3292008700428735
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	4.017450513560327
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	3.8533255553845858
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.	3.773041841006532
Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	3.4711417102218878
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this.	4.0035669235975995
Agenda	1.0709171446689894
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure.	6.311022550353874
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	3.892438837349045
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	2.7360781100180662
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law.	5.873170187733685
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company ' s very existence.	4.17461080398312
A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines.	4.166837516823285
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	3.3988003663233006
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays ' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.	3.5971194674393696
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction.	4.4999005807770915
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	4.422836545819377
In the Sunday papers all over Greece: the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund: the Minister ' s work; the Ministry of Agriculture: the Minister ' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications: the work of the Minister for Telecommunications; the Ministry of Education: the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister; the Ministry of Employment: the work of the Minister for Employment, a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary, and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework.	3.3081974848064784
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	3.23291864027266
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively.	3.5620539741982675
Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions?	4.489928390732183
We would, in this way, violate democracy.	5.862397981290551
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	2.9728062160280917
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.	4.318568714638022
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP.	3.2331121086664023
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People ' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok ' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda ' s report were brought forward in the agenda.	3.4985470863972856
These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.	4.123453895005827
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	4.182372163624523
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.	4.802934036253534
Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide.	3.279153283034421
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked.	5.072907240904122
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	3.642287167395447
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	3.5121964726370725
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.	3.5248279733881294
Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support.	3.807538480552825
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	2.750480554175751
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	3.9296986573062904
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU.	2.8076747294615685
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur ' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	5.269827629805877
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility.	6.200285283593113
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	4.7265150462544945
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	4.021405597446619
It must be visible.	2.788449024037351
Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.	3.7834210466645826
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people.	4.492565573880466
There is no other such policy.	3.483791054479062
In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions.	4.330583876046982
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.	4.95335608356162
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.	3.5978047838411853
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	3.137763332796147
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.	5.245650198994157
He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so!	4.2830737687074185
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.	5.4712295627809535
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.	3.5178942675055875
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	4.44342589801856
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .	3.393797690615958
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament ' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission ' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	4.028109733959765
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	4.760735476903326
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.	3.3325788902251308
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.	4.1787100200479586
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April.	3.9957973499025714
They are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government.	3.971184073043861
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.	5.511898852394333
- (FR) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria.	4.4263241194821195
I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.	4.272083959236776
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.	3.286819211082398
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.	4.146914311673391
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	2.9105199933281334
I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.	3.7253707284543824
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism ' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	4.040382720038034
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	4.034574395231655
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment.	4.046506906857594
Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	3.1170794515815814
Does that give me hope for the year 2000?	3.308784475237431
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.	4.72602264211695
So who is this then?	4.048128098894895
Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators.	3.691121458914814
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	3.4563956160619376
This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities.	4.245354643781694
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	4.832349444032711
They cannot therefore be approved.	3.384409994556454
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative ' s policy unit.	3.7571690983163517
The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty.	3.834844113298136
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	4.298491355945433
Mr President, the Group of the European People ' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	3.672928512069037
This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data.	4.000864525134097
This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union ' s institutions towards the public.	4.497357183386942
Mr President, behind the report, which is an honest one, by Mrs Attwooll, which we shall vote for, we see the European fisheries policy. It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move.	4.146469030065299
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.7729642561226249
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	4.119969118175452
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	4.444171539443686
We have thrown water a life-belt.	4.762522368382438
If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you?	4.663000711630786
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	4.599613139614468
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.	3.250360295326764
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.	4.149848541538715
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe ' s rural heritage.	4.051879178080805
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	3.466224990334104
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities.	4.649281029328327
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.	2.9900163631489876
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.	5.198268571394577
It would be the first in a long time.	3.988344259966886
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	4.2983805889643945
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.	3.4015001287341
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy.	4.52252097315886
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.	3.4691224803218996
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	3.7797079989671065
I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply.	4.102116273087421
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.	2.86160633934226
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	3.9462503503597604
Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application.	3.379080244717586
The Commission must listen to it.	4.074881329890575
I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport.	3.43910784618674
Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	4.003042465629338
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	4.02613224446037
Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems ' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments.	3.284527616288513
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	4.110616703195135
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.	4.416192701322068
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	6.074672111075396

The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.	6.2571854572296175
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.	5.2999546999552205
Subject: High infant mortality levels in Kosovo According to the most recent UN information forwarded to the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe. About 50% of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages.	2.8574416343586266
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	5.420540761701742
The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves.	6.469791702694745
We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it.	3.8283997573482975
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact.	3.7004874191212007
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.	2.870115566419959
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.	5.308804137016438
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	3.8648504975039915
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs.	3.6393615572390843
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	3.9021630073348876
Such a rule is only normal.	2.671011437377844
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	3.82530045611938
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	3.2344477267650937
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	3.5962093231582766
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved.	2.98683023863776
Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.	4.140030887094427
In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field.	3.6314131252862913
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.	3.7694232630098266
The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns.	3.6968022547426593
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.	2.6512654714210804
Capital tax	1.7898691034100052
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	4.11054175687725
The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted.	5.441584325093916
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use, including taxes, in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them.	3.6028970164751146
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	3.543792069010119
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.	4.386187473729857
It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.	3.1299754904761596
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	3.611784626234981
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.	3.523279344594522
Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices.	3.107956081419815
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	6.048950598289165
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries.	5.485151341286958
In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives.	3.4417497458182096
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	3.679527108757283
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	3.592618402146667
However, more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so.	3.536970334022356
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion.	2.961712325629966
Company restructuring in Europe	1.8406216218004672
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction?	4.043245547247373
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	4.407121120401223
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation.	3.39201797855521
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	4.5103168316903375
These discussions essentially cover four areas: security, the structure of government, territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation, as a result of the situation following the partition of the island.	3.419141699116667
Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya.	5.411006323844976
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	4.872870862822641
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	5.309153152955749
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	3.405917262010552
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate?	3.4391428257822043
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.	3.2353395630702906
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	4.644155319016439
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	3.9079049299057877
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7.	3.754573571978304
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	3.3314653854962404
Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future?	2.9760684849337626
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	4.294359981562792
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	4.168098800509327
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	4.2481700147884
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.	2.757694340862511
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	3.3242174823133794
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.	4.474245425987145
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.	3.3857987721953937
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission ' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse.	4.417843171295681
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	3.830707334061003
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success.	4.472743457518255
As regards taxation, state aid, the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products, practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.	3.15151310571717
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council ' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.	4.643753182395471
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	3.9675569719556387
Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland.	2.4780288773413512
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta ' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	4.328146155951906
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.	3.777461826049197
What is meant by the Commission ' s declared objective of 'economic reform ' in the labour market?	4.888712556400136
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law.	4.259442348847029
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union ' s policies to date.	4.179231572793721
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):	2.367505394392421
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations.	6.198662535538565
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	2.6704931410104615
We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them.	3.9679267968042162
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.	4.3462684819827135
Mr President, I also rise on a point of order.	2.6557561426126712
In view of this problem, which seems to me to be the most serious, the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points, particularly with the rapporteur ' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission.	3.632945344667149
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts.	3.81969134054813
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	5.165954052963406
This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it!	5.136456056336718
The damage to your country, Mr President, and to mine, Spain, could be horrendous.	4.640472978170882
And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later.	3.1836332524915245
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	2.5282418235723325
But what will those limits be?	3.938583204519215
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	3.824896188360738
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.	3.4818948926467876
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East ' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place.	4.316653389185511
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation.	6.720438652324047
It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.	4.456621711752908
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	4.025869345919629
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence.	4.101076843583702
Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP ' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives.	3.079921367895298
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency ' s position even more apparent.	4.0776262442308635
Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners ' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific.	3.6950180199155764
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	6.513704733611028
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	3.577289008063372
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties, opening new prospects for this partnership.	3.3214696327166453
Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda.	4.238851951739139
Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified.	4.1069833528414454
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism.	3.402658302959964
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale.	4.181575232894788
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	3.9835835526973185
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.	3.927958150108898
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	3.8517332972040967
But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.	3.526169692767383
The second point is human resources.	3.768324790248291
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!	4.834961331558075
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU ' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	4.456349206870651
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	3.1366494155065405
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	3.8712376514291584
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.	3.637618624390688
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.	4.041727500906571
The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances.	3.937495484122945
We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors.	4.140528130830144
Personally, however, I shall continue to fight against the extreme right, to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria, and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m.	3.547019216475049
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.	3.8885938792717787
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	6.082601932266026
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	3.6006830633281472
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	3.607592925264481
Numerous questions are still outstanding.	2.2302158452153535
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.	4.032189343506288
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments.	3.471662453472396
We want to ensure that the EQUAL report, which is very important for refugees, the elderly, the handicapped and women, simply goes ahead.	4.495734653219968
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	4.096024517029307
In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today.	5.458313776904373
What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse.	4.60162584463327
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.	3.9289901349672087
Let me illustrate this with a topical example.	3.196645743160208
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	3.824582083050073
This will therefore be our rule.	5.851340812669218
Helicopters are therefore needed.	2.0276653776833076
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel ' s proposal and wordings.	4.589686608156599
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	2.930950604807983
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on.	4.2442295365079366
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	3.5739670424539485
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.	3.97526128941385
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.	4.456468945491843
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO ' s action and the legitimacy of that action.	4.03582733994111
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.	5.447238248987507
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.	4.172752864958014
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.	2.779584236286682
What is important, however, is that they have begun.	5.785945155754232
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth.	3.771349524603342
So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress.	3.624227167039393
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.	4.438416170581701
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	4.660431221844172
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	3.3948373977432245
Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States.	2.474357864386703
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	3.9061327187548875
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.	4.905251165998808
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.	4.883550688173239
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying.	3.770372483801792
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	3.558668180574304
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.	2.650970763492388
We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions.	3.2377106476142123
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards" , it also applies between the institutions.	3.8099410425620577
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path.	3.8052742154756336
However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences.	3.4454029444903944
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria.	1.994645885052297
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.	6.7184489523317295
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it.	4.354459856148789
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved.	2.6317609097369776
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy?	5.228204694521291
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	3.8561820496969577
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	3.0492074638565443
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson.	4.510969216622733
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights.	3.2466271660125363
Firstly, there is the Commissioners ' individual responsibility.	2.8671729428235304
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.	4.949146742160548
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	3.3993269435311473
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.	6.019336651055902
Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.	2.608351808052909
Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development.	3.9246512012096084
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	4.895680545916741
The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective.	4.547927457416975
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	3.609344074676342
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.	3.7671913183704016
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely.	3.6139163710059004
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.	3.938231689365933
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.	5.30045042408717
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice.	4.448573481301226
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?	4.805407069098186
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.	3.436137596004725
We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning.	5.404240023359558
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country.	3.312706862228303
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	4.118124518379571
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.	4.05515643610593
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.	4.370756872008058
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.	3.919274970904053
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership.	4.61807693588355
Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	3.6490501911559314
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.	4.921372714224291
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	3.7720344522271656
This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China.	3.932205312205522
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods.	3.9927599286596145
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.	4.648599640127444
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns.	5.935626375555204
We need, in short, to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these.	3.8989561720714083
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.	4.56227750016299
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources.	3.316014087647121
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	3.532564509142815
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly.	3.4395379448483854
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	4.705268233329398
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.	4.800407185233619
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	3.7731291651800563
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	3.391850435007024
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.	4.351961674080587
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	3.0555563507463557
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	3.3980121359452284
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel.	4.228841870685365
And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees.	3.0041378519045066
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better.	3.774144738879381
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation.	3.8395676329807977
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.	4.70657158629859
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	4.4805921558557635
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	3.514613125580111
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	4.1587650421899935
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	4.119155282874055
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	3.7650682983061188
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.	5.018309607741049
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	4.040674784843527
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.	3.016993579231301
(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	3.275430518827666
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	3.1268924365556727
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate.	3.785865154006546
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato ' s report.	4.730777125499862
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	3.4768978859390822
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	3.7013222418108023
To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons.	3.3565085645788018
The introduction of these new technologies is not a threat, but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services, which our tourism needs for an ever-lengthening tourism season, so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism.	3.572768177730296
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	4.44390572626435
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency.	3.0349208343609018
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	3.503696429933642
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.	4.606022635815164
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	4.237826316491728
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	4.202839651479243
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.	3.964992107877903
Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy.	3.4673801123210555
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	4.4159489291019085
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	4.560385926463889
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	5.611479829405064
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission.	4.190754708579683
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism?	4.8225196843384746
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	3.524821545319798
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	3.5018868964357184
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.	3.310983151884189
Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat.	2.794390938815706
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	4.195875637534721
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings.	3.7038724831819363
Are there any comments?	1.2692975256400874
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided.	4.184974138317933
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	3.5564444848707186
(FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise.	2.851802326581861
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.	4.580317112048349
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	4.4019814884552595
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	3.9549639059536106
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	4.891066841421249
Report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999	2.73228558170314
As the Parliament ' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.	5.219013853211095
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question.	3.701861071747169
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.	3.1832375618459445
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	3.953375405376922
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.	5.074859544982447
Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements.	4.089291074524253
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina ' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.	3.5953581183723697
The victims are waiting outside.	6.054905353254696
We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue.	3.888688704841472
Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment.	3.2736036019732055
Will you please therefore undertake, before the next plenary in February, to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately the Council has passed legislation, rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list.	3.665308105368164
Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström.	3.9502132465012374
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	3.4849713118015724
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	4.098013517425766
I do not like the term 'leftovers ' any more than Richard Corbett does.	3.6068332632106683
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.	4.128907932992557
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?	4.607922783508442
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union.	4.300053945746037
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.	6.1628341196291245
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	3.27650599918739
Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations.	3.4762056905525345
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	6.2535497082341
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	1.554147740218332
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.	4.435602599301333
This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.	4.0737543284050775
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman 's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	4.850191923110089
This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.	4.892988611331763
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)	1.9967582287283385
Currently, both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.	2.9765294206691704
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	3.720469013544161
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.	3.7850427606594277
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	4.0022100642735845
As Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic, social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries.	4.2224778526360645
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.	2.880809406856088
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.	4.92556907522352
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.	3.1006964808841913
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.	3.360213167189199
Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions.	3.332434890492165
I perfectly understand Mr Staes ' s concerns.	4.015290315309135
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget.	4.418713470330039
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about.	3.6768100175657485
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.	3.7759271564112487
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago.	4.265122221906885
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council.	4.63218107560631
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event.	3.9516609381664716
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.	3.5195399326812975
Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares?	4.4004469446873955
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	4.543789514003544
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.	4.210422882535998
The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here.	3.4269749140934915
I acknowledge Mr Patten ' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.	3.579548226101377
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.	5.006934510397726
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	2.369990020216934
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.	4.9731972794752455
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	3.2150394754631058
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	4.6689424458772875
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.	3.3211828641568752
Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin.	4.261209663705701
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld ' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	3.6333339800412054
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	4.004111642123019
The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming.	4.561099067621413
In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded.	4.984010119818562
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.	4.465542790486544
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission	2.0641495641751253
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	4.109596151989507
Let us stop the shadow-boxing. Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate.	2.914117274614791
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose.	4.909466289192256
It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy.	4.1853228890775585
A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically.	4.726897472914547
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.	4.088156727531651
In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property.	3.9052110750369122
I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly.	3.1883524734841835
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.	3.6965583519367957
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing.	1.9214699622403597
During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course.	3.4307868743703076
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success.	5.292785634551053
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	4.403456913457697
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	3.557323827408642
There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen.	3.3767103385340502
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.	3.4378726924619727
For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country ' s approval.	3.160477682889423
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	5.195333143550404
There is a limit to how useful that is.	3.111168300681765
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	3.513931511508813
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management.	3.140905369163466
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	4.762133158956703
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	2.8230552094801027
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all.	3.8427784418286755
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.	3.5629829201809478
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.	4.566101383303111
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.	4.0924733839565635
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do.	3.0372511695663937
As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens.	3.423823558278879
This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort.	3.3201126749075396
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union ' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.	3.7886546656921216
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.	4.094684058634559
Women are no homogenous collective.	2.829222911449731
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.	3.6793381086930124
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.	4.111554488851645
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.	4.821402504881379
On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market.	3.469033968399917
What we need here is an integral approach.	3.139704665675572
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.	4.636656890328125
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.	3.6957250377245363
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	5.3790333337119
I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic ' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair.	3.8128034268576063
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	3.691394398390645
However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way.	3.9800242806194484
This Parliament ' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	5.3441729437380445
I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU ' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly.	4.968485839988304
That is all I have to say for the moment.	4.673145008495286
While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches.	4.066935284783654
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different.	3.16420805076208
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.	4.64819620340904
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	3.8041644791366553
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way.	4.915522093199961
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	4.877092522514457
But tomorrow will be too late.	3.8960738313458796
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.	4.374270947925362
Indeed, it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources.	3.8784259531733043
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	5.337479980988586
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	3.198671390053777
The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem.	6.109822856775707
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied.	3.968770152935879
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	3.4613598607180203
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	4.416359304750196
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Culture, for the firm and intelligent position which, each within his own role, they have maintained during the entire conciliation process.	3.146663151642725
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.	3.842582507294483
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2472483132960324
We all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, certain action must be taken.	3.2198825587378597
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	3.3397587428434634
Let us remember what is at stake here.	3.728183404133449
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	4.381634946185591
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	4.5563294054499766
Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates.	3.028870484026613
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.	3.286594572312982
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	6.418716231960673
The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak ' s Government.	3.169070580708849
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all.	3.6907057393949794
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	4.86708491933369
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	5.954926218896822
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved.	3.7589120759283805
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.	3.89624342037446
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	3.286825289961592
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	4.27189099811865
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance.	4.462976981262524
That is a fact of life.	3.9598830696591314
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.	4.354051642465047
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.	2.3672059096547926
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.	3.0569973313022754
It is the Tisza, Hungary ' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt.	3.120586777328877
I salute Mr Schmidt.	6.220123042966939
Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing.	3.6265849089271347
For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke ' s question on this issue.	2.972312542993588
We must therefore find a political solution.	3.583945145510543
We cannot be accused of bad management.	4.252644231866337
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union ' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.	4.099056896451249
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union ' s foreign policy.	4.610041193675849
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.	4.684001829114273
This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve. Thirdly, the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment ' s priorities is an extremely positive step.	4.703193588855944
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):	2.713757372380946
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	4.178962170448325
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	5.0862946902968345
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.	4.565907285422102
If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either.	3.0614213673739745
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.	4.138623144420394
So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this.	3.8745298236515366
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	5.245799339168099
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there.	3.427198723000632
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	4.509110028834199
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	4.830081967609601
I will give you one example of this.	3.2298828857679016
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	3.222204316110053
Mr President, there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security, freedom and justice.	3.7907100249054877
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.	2.9382350552176613
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.	2.2357747383584865
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	3.8657156730978213
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	4.831454934932279
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.	5.436210908019571
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	3.269961014567408
It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo.	4.035498317043739
The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance.	4.161921293370124
Since Tampere, there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.	3.962334098380835
What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d ' Yeu or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch?	3.322256476388412
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.	4.052496164604509
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions.	4.220306089714171
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	3.662595599367927
(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) - Relating to Amendment No 9	4.4930763373956815
In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.	3.5621242473147796
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.	4.560847491699347
(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.6688069022930805
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	4.532193057771771
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	3.8288491706282364
The report that the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated.	4.280618706214921
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons.	4.158873894186825
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	4.158806399256817
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement.	3.798193830593261
Never mind that the Commission ' s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one "non-paper" , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards.	3.744811528864442
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.	3.8688296034816534
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role.	4.227855468361152
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.	3.3187471557986314
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.	4.28737390484948
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States ' annual national plans for employment.	4.226407257864212
All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.	4.1517046564000015
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	4.027004577691094
There are four more sister ships in service at present.	3.162052157920593
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed.	5.202249717575631
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved.	4.139636384447094
Are you prepared to act upon it?	2.995501414095367
Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.	3.7788886863146707
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	4.783115783600662
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.	3.875774521340162
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report.	4.132819282109321
Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important.	4.0515202231141645
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.	3.9887514932448997
I would like to make three brief points.	3.704604150211394
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	4.057376521081045
(FR) Mr President, we have already had the opportunity, at the first reading, to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House.	4.226320872591129
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.	4.690859688921565
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated.	4.540914865206691
That seems to me to be rather too long.	4.064121847171373
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally?	4.1470698923673
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way.	4.479641108286517
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!	4.2894599630512475
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?	3.4102714716821874
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities.	4.032069935042783
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider ' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	3.3255761068434855
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.	3.469892090819692
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.	3.0984291764947134
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.	4.754479370568329
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health.	4.153258234277535
In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	3.6556142085782284
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	3.053235912174255
This is a creative initiative, which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue.	3.9219332347332014
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	3.8729299838784894
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health.	3.3410872845974473
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.	4.489604172707579
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health.	3.608708594054268
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States?	3.519856317576375
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.	3.4817171430711515
The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights.	3.699266009807937
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia ' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000.	3.306626904136763
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version.	3.973339386665986
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured.	4.057821021768922
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	4.460283007046758
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	3.2926296825491144
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	5.236788414683038
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.	4.206334384945938
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.	3.48975228817323
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel ' s balanced report makes clear.	3.2486917066849568
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?	4.521822132040294
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	3.5138889049731943
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	3.615829924033644
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	3.5545054093124357
Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation?	3.151614780619946
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	4.956320335033055
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	3.132032258563572
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.	3.555465199972361
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide?	4.499652154404104
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	2.508634655944821
No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50.	3.5116372569688847
Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways.	3.151813424452429
Mr President, it is pleasing that, despite certain delays and problems, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria.	3.3500036555924906
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.	4.873966894357107
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	4.453994282278857
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.	4.777481602630939
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated.	4.878470129188827
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	4.2215594100427545
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4.	4.849562325005885
This kind of tourism, which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens, is just as important.	3.6005554644663973
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.	4.029599401601125
All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.	3.9621580936142475
The Labour Government ' s record in Britain is also a proud one.	5.126495721310889
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party.	3.5193511226230494
Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region.	2.6051219669424195
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.	3.7434152431717114
Unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers, we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity, as Vaclav Havel said here today, and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity.	3.8040441423563003
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.	4.94350527632284
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised.	4.484456352935718
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	5.318112334824643
This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment.	4.169325698659922
Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human.	3.2026177021282085
What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate.	3.7628885888239507
For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed.	4.158462140294374
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission ' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	3.9107035028260215
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	3.5818020738174745
That would not be a good thing.	6.365614651654123
In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States.	3.9661557323156855
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary.	4.8654836463849644
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	4.54980239839827
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	3.986312357166291
The fact that, due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data, the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale.	3.567477835615519
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	4.311177830728423
It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism.	3.9061548366060928
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union ' s competition policy.	4.4046363125373045
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.	5.806917961621287
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally.	4.050194120567224
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect.	4.789107468853741
However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed.	4.657558726318224
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.	3.1217588655282427
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	3.928116320392219
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.	5.53333753007394
Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.	3.7348164368619927
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.	5.984481971056523
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can ' t have it all. '	3.0219244740268985
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change.	3.991443797089742
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying.	5.037889154125935
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak.	5.288640681552783
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets.	5.03620648558458
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	3.5258908644503104
Let us look at some of these reasons.	3.573834914473408
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	5.509677273430992
Our response must be rapid.	4.038174209229983
In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet.	3.781482252409103
At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.	3.428337419386793
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?	4.12358210253558
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.	3.266255727502257
Do not continue in this vein!	3.430203773893312
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	3.1613524992113438
Thank you very much.	1.937494564271333
Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.	3.8299832244380267
When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough.	2.912633715036706
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.	2.2801705459409023
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium?	3.1683504014780803
These are the three most important aims of the directive.	3.196585937116373
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	3.952623226708454
In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either.	3.6591550172820275
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	3.1896870810228783
By this I mean, of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union.	2.693565468302535
In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament.	3.672531138600509
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	4.486971942038946
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	4.8295247056141815
On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.	3.9467984353679624
At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna.	3.6550146137600326
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.	3.530454476835576
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued.	4.270110487638289
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.	3.250079691180425
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation ' .	3.962407101341335
We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure.	5.07011448634152
So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.	4.577276620951428
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	4.050108963257973
(Applause from the PSE Group)	1.1675143331948095
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society.	4.261562789412512
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	5.427115209801439
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading.	4.378874994307175
Secondly, as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in?	5.7974197622254495
. (SV) Olle Schmidt ' s report is an improvement on the Commission ' s proposal.	3.418662381239702
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	3.8249851035704845
We are also under an obligation to help because of another fact, the fact that Mozambique is one of the few African countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence.	3.7219631590609787
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured.	3.2663354531547313
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices.	3.9538304163224156
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level.	4.093265247782103
Can you please do something about it?	3.1517661766700154
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	3.40657116814685
I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time.	3.6425425183606857
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.937579955576106
Turkey 's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey 's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	1.564804384237203
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	2.726889439628451
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.	5.404230752362389
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	3.6888068145961874
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.	3.7023154273138212
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	7.421929241897632
Commissioner, our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas, while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing.	3.6758926230566584
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.	3.820956855165999
CULTURE 2000	2.0473254948473176
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	3.4640954487933726
We all agree on this.	3.9196988674191404
Turkey 's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey 's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	1.563356705494081
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.	3.4933891500822596
B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain;	2.3438868465768334
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.	4.716589415608946
We welcome the report ' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States.	3.829049032707569
They are political because we are moving on.	4.599528777556226
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	3.443765404427754
Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA.	4.1022959927034615
If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure.	3.9091521330935404
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged.	3.586117011321565
This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.	3.4985791776575073
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	3.1585424151515635
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission ' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly.	4.804125533694831
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.	4.478685686089874
However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure.	3.552863943565856
By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.	5.751427425243062
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies.	5.439818356932313
To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	2.556176212218559
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	4.119447068374335
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	3.392440884271157
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.	4.853521354614284
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.	4.494492676780553
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	2.7284789311448736
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.	4.885467647976725
As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy.	3.011739532231025
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	5.077081761212771
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.	2.548783753582691
Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic.	2.6377494147051603
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	3.98027153423637
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	2.8874692386122445
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.	5.438120189606399
With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled.	3.441960526283734
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.	3.480439157626671
After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers.	3.5921565420323414
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	4.202914872741943
So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.	5.929528124240255
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.	4.041085625582418
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	3.8969099255641866
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.	3.3252428178916786
In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too.	5.314073698493524
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	3.2666954225956806
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority.	3.6132010153674794
We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented.	4.729796631771347
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	3.2491741323804146
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	4.640864507594068
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	3.4817747941924098
In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing.	3.6882182761022144
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge.	3.543432074281469
As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.	4.054066003396365
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?	4.465483195517799
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry?	2.959270648809536
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	2.7689319828462904
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	4.248619938454062
Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war.	3.0932371423391203
Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets.	3.7166621130124784
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	4.059876868989196
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration.	3.891736477533891
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	4.407666287967169
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth ' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation.	3.6089522181477802
Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.	2.7717822965191283
At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto.	3.414165304703292
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.	3.368787477571704
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	4.5587791291026
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	4.784088940543713
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.	4.576307303125735
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.	4.168833289913005
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.9608317685058763
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	3.4297103945034975
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.	3.683763745363635
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	3.7411483447083813
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.	4.305112959918042
I want to emphasise four points.	4.382086021681291
What happens in another part of the world affects us.	5.960184395585178
I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution.	4.1173949438000506
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	4.426073324135152
Mr President, today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.	3.970261929672334
It is also worth noting that International Women ' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.	3.5212731390285197
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	4.091678008911208
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be.	4.097197059605438
We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all.	3.7882530896768554
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed.	1.8775223687129037
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations.	3.249727163399966
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	3.445141702111446
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	4.833992057498904
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	3.142119266589879
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term.	3.370792618151893
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	3.3654289617365496
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.	3.314011402350268
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	4.238992051270715
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	4.07420738068981
Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?	2.684952375079244
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market.	3.3074845341647316
Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission ' s programme.	3.302539900435822
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	3.89807888790205
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development, in particular based on local traditions, techniques and practices, on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy.	3.696368467349565
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.	4.279934850421602
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	3.750513332527043
In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites.	3.9454196011494473
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative	2.6379788515559475
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.	4.860678665197841
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	4.2291525025769925
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	4.231316578291286
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey ' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	4.655589897443085
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.4860394600720443
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):	2.924547236179172
This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area.	4.325907482384111
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.	4.2968003120791645
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur.	3.8247292331001947
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?	3.8329522248964754
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective.	4.407614800065008
In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	4.831885989521068
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement ' [no turning back].	3.403756314107106
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	4.834963030195036
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC.	4.253051797340894
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.	4.282671080888193
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government ' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.	3.6043809999913075
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.	2.9469807721873487
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	3.835115401298051
The new operational environment is, above all, a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before.	3.9357111484026874
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten, Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict.	4.032709941907765
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so.	4.489265204795853
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.	4.066142761280936
All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business.	3.86969164498415
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States.	4.496882736447888
Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.	3.902114835233411
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.	3.7123586909241375
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources.	3.011509949273645
And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition.	5.777035138443382
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	4.40307954984317
That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us.	3.5104836622372395
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	3.1449974544006487
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament ' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	5.315159984111687
- (FR) Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis, all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	3.4810863433195474
We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.	3.346798105213807
It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance.	5.12535620997429
a) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday:	2.107535217306406
We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast.	3.785221233928959
Could you please give an answer on this issue?	2.232316254301976
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	4.674342744977091
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	2.9691607052202613
This will dramatically change the way it operates.	5.440856102432894
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	4.938105729011987
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	3.24547629679431
Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	3.4973252614247277
In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them.	3.677898321388429
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	3.395462934880413
I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier.	3.1262096047818604
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	3.772523998632129
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.	4.225568398961262
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high.	4.3612593676462845
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	3.088009685893957
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	3.067508818138111
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union.	3.447507455364437
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.	3.8777796256107036
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	3.6276662023627235
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.	3.380332518636975
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	3.6843156473891376
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	3.801416133491659
I pay special tribute to him for his success.	4.917008138615181
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient.	4.979817804766401
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	4.626038248913631
Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars.	3.9720132636709766
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.	3.7594312167093613
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important.	3.761309972295828
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	3.5226626461479507
This is the price of the future of generations to come.	5.274749166460693
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.	4.594487356929151
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	5.793246412111494
. As Mrs Wallström explained during yesterday 's debate, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.	2.797761053727576
This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations.	4.208208274651394
Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter.	4.039626051439503
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	4.200402605133521
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	3.6142001560757797
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	2.853891306245068
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	4.126906580637456
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.	4.441748697952132
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.	5.05577147233121
We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.	4.666438826388042
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.	4.149149474424223
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	3.612094180443799
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report, which, although geared more towards a specific sector, is a valuable contribution.	3.394474884867178
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.	4.334236057908144
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.	4.597454532080619
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	3.8473120865641737
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations.	4.771005133314767
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously.	3.8538434928151144
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	4.076276682651362
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	5.371726860681416
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	4.03563795932683
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.	3.824867138428385
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	5.4863898288771695
Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China.	2.8496146669384554
Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area.	3.7802865521769458
Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment.	3.7340704769743525
The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund.	5.761765418875789
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.	4.3906870215427265
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	1.8551863063435148
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	4.534858271818625
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	3.8771224652914102
Report (A5-0034/2000) by Ms Stenzel, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States establishing the guidelines for Community Initiative Programmes (CIPs) for which the Member States are invited to submit proposals for support under the EQUAL initiative (COM(1999) 476 - C5-0260/1999 - 1999/2186(COS)	3.959261257793378
They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation.	5.823157500887012
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.	4.430531630244803
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	3.7113354475055633
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country ' s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children.	2.8247095810286527
However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans.	4.24489005047225
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	5.033041727069104
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation.	3.9526205930503533
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	4.864951749258123
If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.	4.688945029917533
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation)	2.056082737061647
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission ' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates.	3.6915380363247965
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	3.9359958249550773
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.	3.6789779617062908
What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect?	4.341989547229012
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises.	3.6267250765287913
. I accept that.	3.4935575401673935
As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular.	3.1402504950989623
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.	6.286268986302161
A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens ' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past.	4.058516631504624
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.	4.472913412893888
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.	4.184632097815436
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.	5.204105477853262
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.	3.486624167086613
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission ' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise ' .	4.162771236820406
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one.	4.600328232263212
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism.	4.545878317012539
The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas.	6.199263104957151
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace?	3.0777276236722413
B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain).	2.3018627875269897
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	2.2897576272131417
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities, we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women, mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments, and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations, social solidarity.	3.4564816469964352
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	2.9253312145519828
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women.	3.740936204722568
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	4.266991074294451
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another.	3.1227024935453263
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	4.055348139867197
In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months.	3.9745522222099385
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.	2.7573156799342424
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	6.176813683530464
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	3.736236370145423
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	3.4708766333194414
This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries ' own policies.	4.203064229689721
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker ' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms.	4.610778123427586
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	4.450473783664463
The Commission ' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced.	3.400495633768513
The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy.	3.826683398222634
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.	3.715752227525618
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00):	2.574230902440121
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	3.937888196481709
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	3.998485086298124
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.	3.9692365658329103
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	3.1584451739446986
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch.	3.5822782289762314
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg.	4.378869243655561
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	4.415343413409974
It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it.	3.9107911148672376
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?	3.9934602041834846
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.	4.143038831208485
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	4.064114124264829
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management.	3.975850481034226
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	4.223857932659842
Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin ' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything?	3.264372393395591
These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level.	3.5892976889498995
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	4.103016655355533
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	3.733299561588161
This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments.	3.667405046976362
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.	4.127877323951021
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas.	3.8727211758150673
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	4.37825321844791
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.	2.9126480461404722
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	4.52937736136726
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals ' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states ' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	4.075847627090209
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament ' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	4.134942053385901
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.	4.641651885562651
Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with.	4.409281607506574
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive.	3.828993881303004
They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population.	5.8125737386178375
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	3.8457348930979385
This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island.	4.379228477152071
For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco.	4.19225581925981
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.	4.205976199549708
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	3.7105451445332895
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.	5.8783887899504155
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	5.272998700097859
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions.	3.4927492952420085
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate.	3.432778369046791
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission.	4.89823478615968
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	3.596421468935864
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.	3.6051886024305544
If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?	3.3861789481963447
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.	4.160191996956438
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever.	3.7489683504010465
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).	3.531688493497811
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	5.04637443314078
On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation ' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion.	4.597730317022009
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.	4.089624550259797
Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject.	3.8232550942074877
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	2.439238836324523
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	4.290079931749231
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	3.927596956548028
I am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.	4.810411778130706
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness.	3.3162083569054728
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	4.190055730402862
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.	4.334043207108296
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	3.933949980688556
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	4.103799792520295
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.	3.973054198207674
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	6.148798587299392
I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task.	3.2350971823813826
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	4.33702942347045
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis.	5.140387487941217
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	3.916517312991797
In my view, it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments, including this one, so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means.	4.866381769266673
As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values.	5.659736629079161
As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies.	4.77456940099484
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.	3.192649625507864
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	1.825209734247728
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can.	4.323490067593572
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	3.294774337474532
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	4.1214506829183986
But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"!	3.9560995570820836
The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas.	4.956527146457734
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members ' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.	4.100409364246742
However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.	3.251817608808792
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	4.016374044980008
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	3.724506604577711
We cannot accept this.	4.552486379406397
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	2.952625065007636
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.	3.4195832756522933
The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data.	5.07935002917819
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	3.193766735847046
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.	3.5310679639476854
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.	2.935200465129701
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	5.162196587974745
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.	4.693806011725635
We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.	4.206380507626176
Michelin caused a great stir.	2.3477219450941718
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	3.867935139444091
In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether.	3.985064946116154
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	4.561442032597667
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	4.197202912137535
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	4.695965491590778
Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS)	2.822601423402432
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	4.038956126344518
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	3.2079035832662597
For example, the LIFE-Nature project in France, at Grand-Lieu Lake, planned without any coordination, led to a real ecological disaster, the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau, a water course located downstream, destroying spawning beds, filling wetlands, and who knows what else.	2.9406368112565993
Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes.	3.2302111378498295
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society.	4.067774579370915
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	4.372514843985928
At the same time, however, we shut our eyes to the Union ' s own problems: to the violence, inequality, and fourth world reality, which is part of everyday life in the EU.	3.0979384375333994
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	3.2900663542096042
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	6.459182923937481
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider ' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.	4.361792912966234
With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation.	3.4863027083939024
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	4.581183358146987
Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.	3.033598110633826
A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD);	1.9550711265939007
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission ' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	4.922464546275752
We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society.	4.39152867894853
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.	3.215726744778723
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.9499896556025176
During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation.	3.169754128786207
Madam President, there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union.	3.3645609126320934
They need a political deal.	3.4593349951305186
The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo ' s administration.	4.206496412357185
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission ' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	4.125817700408754
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.	3.646856360643056
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	3.9679063971823463
Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now.	3.972406136333783
However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority.	4.184098136128205
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.	3.7652421753135448
However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	3.6619523466117627
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected.	5.520327830985019
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	4.565344128240524
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union ' s regional policy.	4.715769242244982
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	4.154344412645814
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	2.793393125922807
At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking.	3.4774462641604362
Adjournment of the session	1.137185502920295
However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management ' s attitude is socially irreprehensible.	3.7788526055946297
Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts.	4.8680644451489625
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people ' s self-determination.	5.421649982323748
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	3.7290391558596463
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	2.898169619257557
Still on judicial cooperation, considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro, and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance.	4.323247058772198
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter.	4.47402279649745
It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth.	4.281945696609908
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.	3.893764354815281
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	3.2757135236665222
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission ' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	4.325105716381488
I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant.	4.001070841766782
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.	3.5771167205689256
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	4.6903622114870736
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	2.203996731994341
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law.	4.674325189199842
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.	2.5565320757012118
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	5.058982628289984
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day ' s work to be done.	4.5366501302998445
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	3.472492913223747
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	5.246243086202908
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard.	4.653178834584966
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	3.1702569641888383
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.	3.140120764087186
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988.	3.6502574270564545
Colleagues, you know the rules.	2.386990932775462
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union.	4.669275915203298
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.	5.989338090095201
In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified.	3.2889288477658916
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.	2.0660930019346635
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	3.7125040688749977
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	2.6473005172670443
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.	4.5116235598021674
Mr President, may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work.	2.649429543698571
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.	4.100978554644579
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	4.923528405825352
It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States.	3.5723968145032243
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	3.6250402650694706
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.	4.640890191987262
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	4.072547423481366
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	4.499202685938239
We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year.	3.1596105466618596
And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	3.5816569194133367
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy.	3.318120618114854
Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.	3.5837041182855103
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won 't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted.	3.7633007792371838
It is Commissioner Bolkestein ' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year.	4.128799677754029
Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter ' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	3.093016971950835
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.	3.6609367127902592
If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo.	3.284831852697142
On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.	4.563536988455774
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.	3.2294585101423303
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.	3.769849155338789
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	4.051382507570475
I am using the phrase 'is said to be ' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.	3.448033906074518
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	3.0730183809735947
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics.	4.277872357258566
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	4.366709835208619
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	3.1962388736244196
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	3.3676654091372327
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	4.0651313129820394
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.	7.940482983144943
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences.	3.194621138799335
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries.	5.629180646456222
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	5.011385681885398
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process.	2.1515888572443536
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too.	4.019431162230323
Atrocities were not even being recorded.	2.5047249687327304
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.	4.151950603448053
A legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the Structural Funds, as was the case in the past, to obtain some loose change.	3.645220382741623
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.	4.516650080563392
So the honourable Member 's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.	3.909896937604141
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.	4.976530035454115
Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.	3.112538496179024
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.	3.809559758294731
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there.	5.6712360859029785
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider.	4.889344481113006
Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version?	4.8486711988367235
I hope that honourable Members will realise that, regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind, the day-to-day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say governments I mean all governments.	3.796424567384042
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	5.4891950501253195
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	3.7679225107615517
On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us.	3.989774096033859
This applies both to the post and other sectors.	4.042436044455431
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	4.084827422037542
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.	4.547146155767516
I welcome Mr Barnier ' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	5.470678451226534
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.	3.2714133009295794
Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established.	3.556071484519123
This is a basic element of the decision.	4.285813670551338
Now who should pay the costs?	4.219010890593995
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion.	4.818431895609091
The purpose of the Commission 's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists.	6.076786189868272
Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises.	3.6869263753628903
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	4.348937778954308
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.	4.061560579511818
Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission?	3.7993657960929528
In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds.	3.3116540557487806
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.	5.608558984680379
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU ' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica.	3.518506428982391
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested.	6.3089953210903715
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	3.3269154815239914
We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism.	2.8185941337120437
Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.	3.6064054887657813
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	2.823310954800087
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	4.3409125104521795
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	3.2335212324916736
We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost.	4.599575829964389
Report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)	2.5342893042242522
Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.	2.7516499074555676
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	3.078901861841946
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	3.3326173071344893
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	3.8095442074530435
Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest.	2.9652679515191562
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	3.65327203569048
However, I should like to ask a slightly different question.	3.933099941372132
Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.	5.278780556953009
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.	3.314491002096399
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.	3.826976716498113
The Commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	4.532151314237879
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.	5.215504485290648
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	4.321721997884241
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.	2.372850256210724
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000 ' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.	3.734051393207343
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	3.9485532308599884
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6283050878427754
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this.	3.345222989474899
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens ' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU ' s Council of Ministers removed.	4.330793955116945
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met.	4.297884440476121
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France 's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France?	4.137131749203369
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	2.583445858009208
I am, however, optimistic.	6.216284490516637
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	4.396357190446611
Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual.	2.8349554926541196
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	3.561860271678873
I will end by congratulating Mr Viceconte and, as one who comes from Crete, a tourist area, I ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a Europe which needs those jobs.	4.37551641999202
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.	4.502711811472373
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission ' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services.	4.968318200250786
We back the rapporteur ' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	3.6449867688815396
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?	3.475603534715245
I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people ' s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course.	4.374930104554419
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	3.462385704871604
It is therefore political by nature.	3.889213973558989
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer.	4.115381051506175
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency ' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	4.3899244143660985
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	4.991517529913801
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.	3.946707584516404
Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.	3.347785410132319
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	3.0004628565763474
But who defines these tasks?	4.561511142344633
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	3.6116127359658687
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	3.8659529825855614
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	4.0856110869341
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	3.8153465032327722
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	3.8401902591324486
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection.	4.120344025619163
To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.	3.8729253971148947
The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major step forward for the European Union.	3.6013198012616066
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?	2.859913728590015
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba ' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	4.247552614902825
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens.	2.833343149717009
For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament ' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.	4.96132679246611
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.	3.597350021215163
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	3.072834271177694
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.	4.3685758330110005
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.	4.6030660322353585
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation.	4.024296010803278
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	2.7839959308518547
From this vantage point, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy.	3.65367092794669
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	3.4341032763164727
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	2.7957703305745603
I worked in Africa 30 years ago, and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic.	4.362155170520236
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	3.4698742633939283
We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience.	3.9480314791517337
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination	2.9766184904650186
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here.	4.887755222535517
Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.	3.1895525612206024
There must be an overriding economic interest.	3.1672061642329035
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation.	3.5860787061896144
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.	3.8019492121568566
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well.	3.5222306869879727
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	3.9899520871578438
The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and/or environmental degradation.	3.997796520992272
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard.	5.180801637069535
The European Union ' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.	3.709660804625236
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved.	3.996222272087828
All over the world, Europe ' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.	5.484220596877066
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	4.6557879449386075
If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative.	4.651172190667838
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.	3.5568234371526355
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union.	3.279894800419655
The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased.	4.748865726131061
We need to clarify the liability for transactions.	4.012360535336906
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues.	3.6443219196423384
These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits.	4.062448411594656
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	3.011712878474115
If nothing is done now, we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste.	5.360356167366488
I respect Parliament ' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament.	5.267206704263513
We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts.	4.285185198879786
Since then, however, there has been no progress.	4.181960628568249
Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies.	4.203552916625578
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.	4.152089544455571
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.	4.19650182902577
Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue?	4.659386621980934
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.	4.588902644194578
I did not defend attacks on civilians.	4.328567179572253
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.	3.817690232385856
In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position.	5.055575880035837
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.	3.323025146511842
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	4.2962784266898115
This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms.	4.826431553906433
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.	4.471503643200526
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.	3.5287546848829714
He has convinced me of that.	2.738574734670208
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	4.071964094844136
During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy.	3.3372422355161744
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector.	4.532192234080506
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic ' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	3.4209265468898624
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama ' s insights, as he arrived hot-foot from the region.	3.7716304035123294
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission.	4.613620244210436
Before the vote:	2.756543997492972
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	4.248969470657839
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003.	5.613687909469838
. I welcome Mr Brok ' s report supporting with amendments the Commission ' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.	4.375781912746481
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	3.560646854840475
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.	3.670279463462443
Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)	2.5747357047413666
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	5.589068329691992
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance.	4.582921932666528
This is an irreparable loss.	3.9760053780645284
These costs are not very high.	4.881239779250898
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.	2.9490730394553006
All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.	4.165760517039513
Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power.	3.3494408212042464
At the end of the day, Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.	3.002284912702738
First, and the Commissioner has also confirmed this, because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets.	3.947018954098247
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety.	5.088705470309761
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned.	3.1594515755017203
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.	3.8939279728040206
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	3.0835194506376817
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	3.884329066527676
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic.	4.454433542790041
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.	3.1623055533789883
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants.	3.791141584283498
Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.	3.5911841199723304
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor ' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	4.224174394969453
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	3.4273415361698807
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.	3.194035720011894
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant ' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	3.872089849906418
But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission.	3.342869264526399
Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.	3.078316480472388
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.	3.0944582225991204
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	4.855226902731794
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	4.84430504794613
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well.	3.113986118914679
Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.	4.926936384635175
Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos.	4.494585720442959
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing, we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side.	3.9462236493412983
We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society.	4.153980089090899
This is why I am voting against the report.	3.0660598180339256
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue?	2.8868204852566395
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	4.346278879740002
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.	4.200980911217801
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue.	3.6202306479372286
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	4.109479066997649
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East.	3.6693548406362604
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	3.2444349195573716
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest.	3.362115116338755
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	3.1100516740337274
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States ' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer.	6.308238360146025
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	4.212080506222043
There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me.	3.6700625816670933
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.	4.427490040302487
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.	4.529903905491655
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	4.7218813085496425
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	4.64645852051334
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead" car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.	3.309393736143456
In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following:	5.098475108534901
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility, for the fifteen Member States of the Union, of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy, a sensible European Union initiative in this field.	3.503235788594665
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	4.798878347213531
At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat.	2.404176056949543
The question which I therefore ask myself is this: has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area, how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence?	5.191358181733644
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	4.564684248584311
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House.	5.609002582279219
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	4.053165446756349
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale ' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	3.094814302021564
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.	2.2581577797069126
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.	4.590493659849497
The first principle means creating a new 'pact ' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside ' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside ' s recreation value.	3.8682632205960816
Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters.	3.030391847923901
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	3.899071451281163
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.	4.56181620242155
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition.	4.7851820623808
Bearing this in mind, I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter.	2.6767955950190245
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	3.0485244699871217
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	4.346905931369527
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine.	2.353086103695168
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.6986635673103554
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.	3.30103295526068
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.	4.50212108992966
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.	3.8665872849193854
I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given.	3.8602297622113797
This motion asks the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax. It also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens.	3.704016548117514
We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.	3.8759298811530862
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets. In three or four days, this can equal the total figure of annual global production, or global GDP, of approximately EUR 6 000 billion.	2.891792124652409
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	4.475230546168356
Agenda	1.0709171446689894
.	1.3940351656188106
An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view.	2.8090906912708595
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	5.985966487629512
In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe.	3.518018282224717
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	4.101962230202809
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	3.9885432934071354
Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	3.287317152227017
But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is.	3.7381844088506835
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all.	3.2076036815285565
Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget.	2.89637929353167
In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later.	4.3107728614750584
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	3.63148280463705
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	4.331039861730905
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	4.510510255508511
Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.	2.54704694359721
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.	3.8675023008665215
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water.	3.8390048333032483
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	4.039928943497597
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration ' , as others too have said here.	3.921125777842346
Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	3.503406970918619
We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States.	3.4530498036553476
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	3.0891741540686546
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	4.330484645047434
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	4.737726780569249
If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem?	3.3648282798521185
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control.	3.877964083727467
I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation.	5.182622440856893
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.	3.4602434338703114
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	3.5053943867015045
Mr President, ever since Plato ' s 'Republic ' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	3.2432742035227724
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	4.493032692157453
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee ' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings.	4.072268945925297
In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon.	3.311594605976131
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	3.352941048677461
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.	4.017052535694916
We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems.	4.21434924846651
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	4.158839990555321
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	4.24709379502275
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	4.119266167772928
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	3.968528753409927
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.	4.546654170286712
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission ' s humanitarian aid policy.	4.762621077067805
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence.	4.7136189317502595
Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be.	3.0717263413004923
Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.	3.5988722386290024
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within.	4.132300812541156
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too.	3.1341519048757647
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system.	5.578621913879035
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States.	4.625612860162162
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	4.369326789296105
Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission.	3.1529572163162216
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate.	6.154007223970913
We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas.	2.854938180227437
When we discuss the TSE regulation, Commissioner, we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation, such as cosmetics, medicinal products or animal feed.	3.3466566194647727
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	4.7292563715527285
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes.	5.669274555561323
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability ' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	3.7469834390277734
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.	3.1915586802120153
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!	5.548901754807898
Report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS)	1.950905538882422
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	3.9812189344358773
The pattern of intimidation is clear.	4.458964615157854
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this!	3.509221290375619
If the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.	3.3997919648183763
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that.	3.6936971428779874
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.	4.921950847833545
Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal.	3.3303203297751116
It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.	4.6619910438761405
So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.	4.3768572537716794
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	4.173570260460613
The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements.	3.7949148600463696
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	4.629248364175377
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	3.542336281840602
He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning ' s meeting.	4.001960128512532
Since then, the victims ' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	3.6880584681311768
For example, at least in the countries which I know well, I doubt that the intention, repeated three or four times in the Commission document, to reform 'Europe ' s social protection, health care and pension systems <URL> a climate of more cautious public spending ' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back.	3.84611697790123
Very well: that is to be the unchanging rule.	6.0239309789374875
Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross.	2.6828429902676714
This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future.	4.454759807529314
We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people.	3.8281834260956153
Another important area is protection of the groundwater.	3.2428938652724404
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected.	3.375597865147173
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.	3.3842378147392806
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world ' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.	3.4498605934172764
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men ' s lives.	3.9616280214364394
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	3.4912207564285946
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	3.5557785682997887
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern.	4.229264176573647
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.	3.7254610612410772
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	3.1249775524926093
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.	4.768312101952659
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	3.700431560603583
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States ' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure.	3.414827321656643
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.	5.247376003589637
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers ' expense.	4.208580346291338
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	4.0281973579040615
The appeal by the European Socialists, on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel, raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation.	4.408689580524203
Now, the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law.	3.8909817777420943
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.	5.4491275863055
Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission ' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	4.078162288443041
Answers are still awaited.	2.1968410988840343
This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty.	4.064917576255252
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.	3.177136001854701
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.	4.561586813324842
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	3.8564844149414004
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.	3.935819545943983
Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved.	3.490933115224148
I would particularly draw my colleagues ' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men.	4.00566298919413
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	4.624812330127748
All those things come together.	3.431957160109046
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.	3.437093995099724
	1.0363974359942942
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.	5.048620797289814
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	4.546994004495103
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question.	4.900500860992883
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	3.7387164170265073
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	3.3780629305908305
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.	4.126481162711061
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	1.8732748851738263
As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them.	3.7717847567318494
Next, we have flags of convenience.	1.9840136469689078
I have given you my answer.	4.280025878976368
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	1.8863810877139062
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.	6.561412884636622
The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies.	4.393566319498601
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent?	3.6489483003472523
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.	3.7475600440761
(The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.)	1.9451468837011094
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	4.003285988529755
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?	4.068208707432612
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	4.652887129265827
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system.	3.330535740105853
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.	3.964824803776085
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	3.7009424824984767
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.	5.08323636021431
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years ' time about the future of the policy.	4.257324064366832
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union.	4.029052532151733
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	3.8672422587591915
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	3.71289654768161
Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly.	2.9407063674713023
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	4.7934089648527225
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on.	3.8973010623249493
Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.	3.601126397971459
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.	3.3840927824788407
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.	3.7158927560222077
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee.	5.990629307262017
In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion.	4.156296379094346
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries.	3.3802920842782047
The rapporteur ' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	5.223097273419485
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	3.1917744274142383
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.	3.5390762943239285
If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste.	2.9753564151693164
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique.	2.4778477550471467
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	3.5101521757646674
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements.	2.230521806823145
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.	4.776506991636272
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	3.532056894282406
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	4.405380812185775
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.	3.6594584631833578
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe.	4.097064853934527
A key problem is the time factor.	5.446745528110122
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	3.926448412962511
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.	4.220713465371457
I have some sympathy with the Commission 's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally.	6.303357140612737
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions.	4.1749325301455205
We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly.	4.649275249138433
However, I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution.	6.447343825138227
Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all.	4.346728146438763
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis ' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect.	3.3936697160536435
I would ask you to support this common position.	3.4594167487108263
Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other ' s competence.	3.772356235071207
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together.	4.226192630042197
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers ' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	4.429851475772309
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	4.302605096571078
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.	4.7105994258787725
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society?	4.9148235428468094
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today ' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	4.078332646870764
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	4.478780510545031
The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS).	2.554799060362805
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.	3.2971709691497066
It is about brominated flame retardants.	3.429658304192094
It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers.	3.796693255998802
We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another.	5.533174683648817
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	3.988291520170625
Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus.	3.426320414485342
I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.	4.702490664134693
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	3.9036880355404193
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	4.092860555530223
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.	4.1482595394822965
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency.	3.6982582279236587
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House.	5.287231385451159
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union.	3.6152783405020585
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility.	2.6588307344557656
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	4.085281987269509
I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out.	3.383283218210284
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters.	3.6791774197732474
	1.0363974359942942
Transport of dangerous goods by road	3.0534202438975497
We share them.	6.150870000356966
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	3.248299531881592
For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.	3.914648579225897
Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects.	3.75284718195867
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	4.102508528539399
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.	4.922686595841868
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	3.13477904806999
Parliament is a separate subject.	4.332045240019545
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.	3.5724848173300443
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored.	3.991500501872227
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	3.5485243327209837
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support.	3.7871816205416797
(Loud applause)	1.0387039174734527
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House.	4.557221757176654
It is not a quota!	5.312071395348173
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.	2.6893033737159224
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.	3.15482062134092
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.	6.608473548652556
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	5.596209717390804
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.	3.9992258361380726
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.	5.6717239496916285
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch.	3.346824666176047
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	3.6801805070722486
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.	4.769878496939471
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.	3.783979092448226
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?	3.313103385070082
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation.	4.000054017383586
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole.	3.5783510264502185
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.	3.1844940854348023
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	4.561506717167422
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.	3.113999799350161
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	3.7863230511633033
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	4.729859867354176
The Council?	9.462664151954195
I have explained the position of the Commission.	4.25003706568236
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process.	4.657901938454635
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	4.603999226401698
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	2.6790089170087854
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.	2.8672711484644737
Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that "the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter.	3.611467710976117
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.	3.3382103621815133
In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created.	4.655253893665749
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	2.5604351181891083
Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	3.419366214585966
What kind of horse-trading system is this?	2.9982114142077685
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	5.999639948542002
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	2.9689974686105636
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people ' s health and the ecosystems.	4.137915448628179
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	3.9610876599974465
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House.	4.014998129295554
I would also like to support Mr Titley ' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.	3.7004650975793645
Parliament ' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets.	4.74657752212718
In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency.	3.3678539233084184
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part.	3.4998473436737796
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.	4.470855095057591
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	3.6897456212107707
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.	4.537104177328809
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people. We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner.	5.059645032188785
This proposal can therefore be approved.	4.187391750783745
If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past.	4.187263479521743
How will these people be selected?	3.3479652889235796
Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue.	4.611658334953636
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House.	3.8656052600846094
However, in moving forward, what should we be financing?	3.9455076812839645
That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken.	3.603698668668905
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.	3.2944032871785263
It is about a Commission which is no more.	4.9840135400191965
Commissioner, this morning President Prodi, among others, stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively, the very credibility of the European Union is on trial, and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed.	3.9019832708578694
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	4.274383392295773
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.	4.0498133311227
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?	2.8243626358267844
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed.	3.480320795305796
No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold.	2.929546326425481
According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful.	3.561106299661394
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	4.965273758531762
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	1.7684995801033925
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.	4.1641198987198935
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.	5.058625438142981
President.	1.3240504952729728
Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union ' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage.	3.8326036128519294
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	3.457328148512815
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.	4.243997101289225
First part	4.404145915975391
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered.	4.063798789549724
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained?	3.4008133148719057
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars.	4.370260154309437
Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe.	4.360780683470404
Certain isolated passages in the Commission ' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries.	3.7342039255448234
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	3.7545146415548336
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	3.8271873795964697
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	4.809371895775226
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	4.120212621072479
The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations.	4.744142192019123
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe.	4.323691191713162
In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.	4.362602913577921
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union ' s desire to communitise urban policy.	5.260640746256961
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	3.2169747705195486
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	3.971725815563813
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment.	2.941974953776085
Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?	4.040838764643534
Women in the decision-making process	4.817292859041524
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights.	3.262799675695115
I note that Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base.	3.4227718507494513
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	2.0633183158198753
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must, regrettably, punish it for losing so much.	3.3399039613063044
Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria.	3.9486400558058876
A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.	4.989146102595469
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.	3.4889658457784245
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.	3.5131792494648852
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier ' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	4.353466897794467
Finally, Mr Prodi ' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	3.3946636985378955
I beg you to intervene.	5.489980557359149
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges.	5.123426276839879
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.0721613020966196
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present.	4.129348921098612
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	4.16309318383463
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House.	3.7866096253336403
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	3.7591387639297267
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.	3.530789115412988
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.	3.351193625357434
I think that we need, first and foremost, to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations.	3.8240075133440565
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	5.162858858531461
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002, everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro.	3.6768936628420255
Water is a prerequisite for human life.	2.3695694315698557
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community, reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe?	3.3579811258983363
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	4.787455249848135
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.	4.935731522023794
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.	4.01786719785409
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	2.109166282446066
The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them.	4.962756685985888
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.	3.9621943635817276
As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty.	4.897665874795944
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.	3.875903691707186
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	4.020977450954784
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	5.15006310195342
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	4.044293215882231
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	4.882791179361116
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	3.2056514827545546
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.	3.0353851767682554
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	3.1903060605408995
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	4.651683803000678
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.	3.941062134593952
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	3.285584607399338
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	4.274244174520341
The joint debate is closed.	2.945725866164446
In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results.	3.9391048349486604
Madam President, we simply have a few translation problems in this area too.	4.198855449805795
The same can be said with regard to transfers.	5.974036851870642
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	4.977395442550608
It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days.	3.8505547054500764
I understand your concern about the rights of children.	4.7430931526977185
Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter ' s content.	3.1436447786050348
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	5.1073262926239416
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism.	3.1232422622089904
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.	5.017369531061605
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	3.6763269909776386
Parliament has frequently made that point.	2.7206119966833255
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one ' s friends unfortunately still exists.	3.7225734169917257
I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.	4.516011875873751
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office.	3.7094832070376107
Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water.	4.548196570915138
It is about artists ' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products.	3.2723317532914833
My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas?	3.880635392402853
The words 'issued by ' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities ' .	4.944309255457308
When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying.	4.159648390946443
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	5.724801297816409
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians.	2.8961054114255593
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians.	3.98153534452006
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas, giving it worldwide scope.	3.33379940764991
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.	3.8331310990124923
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.	3.203633432958606
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	4.206036837171177
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands.	3.649988203294868
.	1.3940351656188106
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)	3.463058213959894
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators.	3.902072237167299
I will tell you a few things we should do.	4.742741143948764
If this 'feedback ' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	4.261939833327133
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.	3.37118397526116
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.	3.2018991856474415
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	3.929726983478934
And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop.	3.162823762923964
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.	6.157799173761997
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.	4.73939301793393
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	2.50452358902127
In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.	5.222149583558131
This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters.	4.233795497092273
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	5.353872912571106
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation.	4.146989082196356
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	3.3738290464764784
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	4.23805392008962
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	4.350467186813677
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner ' s outstanding bills.	4.0530036778279115
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	3.606555788970693
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	5.1436826500381585
Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	3.7840271815510658
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.	5.259597379079991
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	4.255155640606411
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino ' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.	4.617152556443882
The common position is a reasonable compromise.	4.981251678040471
I would like to comment on two things. Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes.	3.367136990741414
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	4.228314320326855
This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example.	4.363967156769647
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	4.273286885066114
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	4.80863136556111
We all took part in it, not just one group.	4.701054956226372
One example of this is the 'Celtic ' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.	3.8667937253607225
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	3.2523791870008623
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions.	3.3435740403929373
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	4.249376467565205
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern.	3.361752974870601
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	3.856982409181413
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	4.444886843883497
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	4.020886335268541
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	4.025657472263195
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.	2.9077835142365407
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.	3.2717020893958897
In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!	3.915857025142079
In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date.	3.709985626402391
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	2.9875203003871453
.	1.3940351656188106
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.	3.0284198654830985
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.	3.0398985789317416
In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	4.934001212279503
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years.	5.468897167052557
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN)?	3.314566857439724
In reality, the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic.	4.032617329655111
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.	4.547242440619523
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	4.920210290008564
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.	3.6705781186740847
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour!	4.020843667032068
When the Commission ' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	4.082141926464173
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.4860394600720443
What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party?	3.177646261518622
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	5.312267401925344
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.	3.9432042332605635
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price.	4.127714571152177
. Mr President, this has been a very useful debate.	5.20706935263342
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.	3.60768203699045
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	5.2279567304764205
This is also an important point.	3.8881287251490777
I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular.	3.81695399901905
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.	4.2670941154494315
It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states.	3.3611222670721173
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	3.784339268292769
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	4.258067198435941
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.	6.0497783929962665
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	5.54311730509071
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	3.775515147646191
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	4.067613974022586
What else can we do to support this opposition?	5.777599764605554
Mr President, as a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia, I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues. I shall, of course, be brief.	3.5344941646683217
Why would it not work elsewhere?	3.552355184345627
And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long.	3.7395752104652744
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy.	4.920360103689235
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	3.006852218277702
Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules.	3.8348560441657376
This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.	4.102194898519566
At or around the time of President Clinton 's visit to China, the President of the People 's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	3.346673975621415
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform?	3.0821788225848286
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.	3.7428131357489436
In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said.	5.740176819973882
But I want to add a word of caution.	6.030477617881042
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.	3.4825681173961214
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence.	4.4775846178914405
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	4.100458319329507
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer ' s liability.	2.475352912967787
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	4.7793185997939736
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.	4.0200090760997185
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.	3.0198462100221732
We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.	4.1062804379157685
We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.	3.4056069583541904
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	5.380650623094377
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.	3.2583155113622104
This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries ' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community ' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited.	3.3155622532830473
Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment.	3.5089043720433923
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions.	4.2822563358956796
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.	3.831212999327228
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.	3.5374023758618613
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.	5.722930673060134
The European Union voted against that motion.	4.012096039110857
Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	4.094847332630546
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation.	3.780498202165634
Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy ' .	2.413485558703573
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.	3.461095789928946
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3.	3.69827065189413
We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place.	4.01076723293529
As Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents.	3.293698579685895
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	3.1709554923761436
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.	4.912134368844403
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.	4.440121186600013
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	4.159729384088866
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	4.606347070265509
In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use.	3.112338899600436
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.	3.3269502397123953
Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.	1.7872368876296156
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions.	3.5456660258410606
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.	4.242963459853036
Are there any comments?	1.2692975256400874
For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas.	3.694581615389755
That concludes questions to the Council.	3.3175424519699077
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work.	4.663549053507552
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.	4.354928483209961
However, there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union.	3.9292961340706483
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.	3.5062780996644753
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	3.816498976855838
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	2.7163563799231834
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU ' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex.	4.431940612350125
SAVE	2.6769333608670967
In six months ' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation ' s effects upon the Commission ' s role.	5.055256849949946
Anyway, we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more.	2.3200318699936577
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	3.742342955834502
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.	4.214615416228036
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.	3.3810427697371432
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	5.241924894055724
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.	3.547862558858876
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	2.9473826586907212
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	3.8291675835075756
Our policies in Africa lack coherence.	3.9678349645317574
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	3.3506369570302583
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government.	6.297773638147341
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review ' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].	2.682771407267287
This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean.	4.315224982540654
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.	3.3764748229897186
And how should we achieve this?	3.78712857153881
Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon.	2.736135666696332
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.	3.8879827134960343
You see, the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport, its reduced cost, and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe.	3.147641176917144
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	3.71358677546775
However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes.	2.969661360941171
Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself.	5.068818287719928
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.	4.5219167657991575
But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse.	3.3444229056492483
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres.	3.97239978185801
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.	4.698144834918139
However, some people ' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators.	3.6970495802262238
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November.	4.62116510129164
Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.	5.849459036891785
We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda.	3.39467170556567
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process.	2.8760553540329865
The Arab world ' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria ' s fight for freedom against France.	3.674905732309813
However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.	3.412057728531151
The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	3.4944814773364508
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	3.2108697314161203
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	4.685168293338929
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	3.561219368166342
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	3.716513197849274
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report.	4.206075518369098
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks.	3.9920933057950414
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe ' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	5.2665161818351605
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.	3.963042384185375
We would like to know their names and their faces.	4.437184682322277
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found, and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of.	4.203508881852092
Report by Olle Schmidt (A5-0025/2000)	3.320752387803099
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.	4.654113613617566
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level.	3.614910779459573
But is there not more to it than that?	3.8401844021997134
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.	8.248901910677437
In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives.	3.4185087540931622
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	4.167832195125754
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive.	3.4834122866541373
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better ' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations.	3.258573383491744
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	4.662210702257563
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.	3.6301792882068304
I do not know whether this is in order, and I would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the House.	3.8661176268279447
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States ' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases.	3.5036397373336414
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	3.5021912572034815
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.	3.0611985830782396
In addition, I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.	3.711836065293132
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	4.192612854812648
I think this proposal is a good one.	5.301311779479815
That is usually the case.	3.1994227416830094
Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today ' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone.	4.799136774889987
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	5.144766762902274
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.	5.472914324764081
As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts.	4.321274135590233
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	3.725746212748933
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	4.276047001457916
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress.	4.841758586757034
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system.	3.9864767633789526
Secondly, Cuba.	5.0817212258605595
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	4.426352662608452
The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled.	4.291025742356292
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there.	4.084936898571503
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	5.310460047514703
I wish we were closer to that.	4.351248314067478
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	4.471604782041831
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.	4.5616041295893055
During Mr Bolkestein ' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."	3.3222766660626557
If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake.	4.040203578906191
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière ' s report.	2.71556899008863
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due.	3.3636456014200427
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU.	3.7793018734190884
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	3.4398667524359112
Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago.	3.841043803787157
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.	4.956184216331266
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last.	4.110869377382428
Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled.	3.370537140982907
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.	3.0415689595666104
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	4.596762899451294
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	3.6344892608110446
The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles.	5.527535131282132
Nevertheless, I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations, but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective, we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective.	5.204689789590269
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.	3.6244963075833554
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	2.796903542129398
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.	2.761891556499463
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.	4.115889714720836
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.	4.17524727894273
Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years.	3.894350811709738
Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too.	3.894038679812523
During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession ' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.	4.050155756416788
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	4.21057652635442
It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.423585758242171
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.	4.642760530606044
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	4.098426449628695
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	2.3885759407310894
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	4.030463997349093
Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament ' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers.	4.1550228001996405
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	3.8715700275551543
Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation.	4.902371937105351
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	3.2478367460811395
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.	4.523769207490214
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union ' s being able to function come what may.	4.165986259928362
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	3.8098099688729827
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy.	4.160367919467939
We need to open that debate.	3.8556076874896963
I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path, which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union, we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine.	4.692912804562094
Nevertheless, these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union, despite its well-known human rights violations.	2.725098766577695
Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet ' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.	3.418696492846316
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom.	2.80034088482499
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	3.116543212697856

If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.	3.8191522590917173
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.	3.971196334998313
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	3.1955358421160063
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog.	4.3370666692497855
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.	2.2932090408047556
The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems.	3.566413674190889
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.	4.386059213635612
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.	4.234017355409515
If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	4.241892530183569
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	4.452354166986425
. (DE) Madam President, I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification, because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations.	4.20280583816446
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	4.302134512256366
The last question concerns the amount granted.	5.792189996925059
I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.	4.318637876956408
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	4.346918934406531
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced.	3.324308978257742
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.	3.5904490470256425
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them.	5.086719126034762
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.	3.128541938561798
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.	4.309996936891356
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	2.654558967137261

No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	3.548630192642219
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission ' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	4.369249964114325
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	3.581514886044151
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	3.699090408069448
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive.	5.113148585894478
How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe.	2.5798144664154616
As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported.	3.0161770582917584
Because they have to face social obstacles. Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest.	3.925035929441236
It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU.	4.289095293053936
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people ' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative.	3.9533399557953652
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	3.60899542762377
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	4.42583634627258
Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further.	7.020225562261224
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	4.461914242697861
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.	3.5302129246079925
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.	3.8797741051746595
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	4.305151251302966
That does not apply to Austria alone.	3.432638121325452
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	3.9601010077403096
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.	3.540522793601408
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	4.716995678665728
.	1.3940351656188106
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position.	4.287715252030128
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.	4.0805459341480255
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.	3.7247990827421464
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	3.9150985732574624
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.	4.873059497388349
In 1995, a five-year derogation period was decided upon, which is now lapsing.	4.580019475768042
However, the appointment was cancelled at the last minute.	4.3294758885868525
Report (A5-0007/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)0003 - C5-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD)	2.072986907009895
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.	3.6035857345292355
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	4.062724643890349
Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.	4.8361126556512435
I hope that this will be of benefit.	4.90671789237061
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):	2.533281977737114
Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge.	2.815485329984716
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future.	3.625057261226905
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	4.243936224943869
It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union ' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars.	4.577937780869172
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.	3.6614426307640513
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.	3.6744556631066625
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon ' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	3.75364452183581
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.	3.8836185820569833
The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry.	5.117376288126462
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.	2.7327106435706616
However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general.	4.303887634009363
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector.	4.384144149331903
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	4.163618739434314
How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know.	3.4048473487196635
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	5.339384613071347
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).	3.368116087857653
Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars.	3.3964593280227793
Maritime transport, industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing.	2.7777880162958337
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	4.40916239913869
Quite the reverse, in fact.	2.1139747395626047
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	3.746278244155695
Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid.	2.625660922119865
But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward.	4.273017351171753
We wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States, even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past.	4.816015418277292
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life ' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.	4.292385279890559
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.	4.551402054201081
Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.	4.528969075819353
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	3.7598827480321577
For this reason, I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level.	3.4650268693327266
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	3.6418502301500078
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.	4.030657238163085
In Europe, in your rapporteur ' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.	4.149921529053628
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	4.505282078248723
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7.	4.401109631395044
This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.	3.445375283633544
Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life.	3.6749066699942676
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency ' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust.	4.430511411399448
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	3.4048448299908216
First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base.	3.681968053549762
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	4.076152657448257
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	4.893241244502557
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing.	4.896496944407713
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.8272015701965016
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly.	3.298810913523534
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks.	5.105454976836561
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security.	3.5324252164359318
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident.	3.9728776332094333
It lasted only five months.	5.202446152487793
I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."	3.535121450016022
We need structural reforms in the European economy.	6.643932642732249
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.	3.7385742629326284
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission ' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	4.956119114200668
Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts?	2.715408026762444
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.	4.122475763523988
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that.	4.801964651128411
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations.	4.017377684197268
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign.	5.202052027136887
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.	3.741000606194605
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	3.2599570034917256
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today.	6.940433827600128
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	3.740068148216165
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.	4.091753450487744
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.	4.044990755650706
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.5058264775679655
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	3.589610377120967
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other.	4.182767643987602
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	3.8181347167736197
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission.	3.8945331153480156
I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	3.297798478403423
For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances.	4.3230542685700595
Mr President, today ' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.	3.7569710687967084
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.	3.543035430894009
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.	4.05854997801705
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	4.318975491112189
And people have spoken in the past about BSE.	5.347054306408664
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	4.486167665939036
Lastly then, Europol, which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments, with which Parliament is familiar, to make Europol ' s operations viable but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain, and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol ' s powers and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.	3.7119428283930023
But opinion differs as to the solution.	4.355088893939063
We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.	3.937435948160854
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.	3.05008550580343
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	4.2905070821328914
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	3.200864580954288
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	2.580611004318485
Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report	2.831699604328696
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era.	5.3523769552228755
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.	4.52566225522399
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan.	3.4586799390322818
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.	4.663851547823851
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	4.7501594512684004
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	4.15608396162422
However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries.	4.210912922721478
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence.	3.241445315512825
No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties.	3.4782836183370676
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	3.714425303044211
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission ' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.	6.661171177099875
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria ' s.	5.302635493564635
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question.	3.773870249235639
What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.	4.7438261461631885
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel ' s support.	4.193390646694884
Senior citizens are always on holiday, all year round, from 1 January through to 31 December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year.	3.3770355752552086
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information.	3.932427741155982
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	4.161246292365506
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.	3.3743442661955405
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe.	4.649101995654369
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.	5.066618562549731
It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and, therefore, to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy.	3.5098754750403995
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council.	3.492807931359139
That has never been the intention.	4.29082444423067
Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance.	2.8119687063539316
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	3.7845979599296506
Mr President, there are three points I wish to address.	4.423309814745974
But there are some questions still outstanding.	3.6318651922713006
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?	4.201809630357994
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.	3.5597960585119557
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.	4.478832904700871
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux, consultation and control, and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place.	3.2637876041546248
One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion.	3.283879416438341
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	5.251129365316908
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000 ' framework programme.	2.792042058118452
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures.	4.814787652054816
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	3.6965189610020817
Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity.	3.615125591876024
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.	3.693861036638729
Appropriate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate.	3.1154288228686515
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.	5.422424188716047
Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales.	3.4744036781786973
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.	5.536070080229366
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union ' s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter, so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens.	4.8095455857778875
What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly.	4.08302646571609
This is good, but it is not enough.	4.277527518644608
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.	4.15438047303329
In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.	4.486898966721028
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	5.702573644730298
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	3.7193337076061037
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	4.66322059575089
In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.	3.6571159974429017
We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition.	4.683106493374421
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.	4.5275745641144765
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.	4.111464338164735
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time within the space of four months, we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe.	2.8081884838865316
We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider ' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures.	3.5316386849500976
Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal.	3.6693672779211894
This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained.	4.6995648266519625
Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States.	3.0817415419627876
We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.	3.8117317761812313
Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer.	3.9070185060225944
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	4.1212221377732945
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.	4.9058195512233755
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	3.300036490288125
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.	3.0402039257054243
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe.	4.699134949317417
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	5.890802537992935
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.	3.478285798339368
First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes.	3.801290182602583
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right.	3.265818467255886
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	4.156745884862097
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal.	4.661416659246947
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.	2.7570385252912852
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.	3.9916696057355012
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.	3.240058931429134
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far.	3.8932194361550154
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	4.435878449512947
The "physico-chemical and ecological quality of water" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally.	4.1829063068301435
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December.	4.820844611081277
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).	3.2571381848738277
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission ' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.	5.858931559602374
This is the crux of the matter.	2.2072256242165067
We must win back their faith in EU politics.	3.903555368843507
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.	3.387141740877125
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote.	4.187341887513789
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	3.370157195071608
To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee.	3.453423981379756
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika ' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	3.324903498335721
I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.	3.900957828210488
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.	3.8860036934043345
This will determine the success of our work.	4.742741199990602
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers ' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory '.	3.0896106745436254
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned.	3.6196732163405008
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days.	5.033293653232539
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.	4.289451558309663
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	4.390217326992617
What are the Commission 's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	1.94032354628213
However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection.	4.0296997253709215
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.	4.120074109744708
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	3.2877650812422763
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you.	4.4565074348225915
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	3.5646960170711655
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	4.390492587575704
I would like to answer these two questions as follows.	3.5776039301960423
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol.	4.579171465516254
The Commission ' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	3.353412179531784
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	3.573804294035073
By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations.	3.79871900931695
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period, I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations.	3.3322234595326847
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward.	3.143942558438901
Mrs Theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.	3.6688935686123223
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	4.858868255622376
Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.	3.765725351536173
Moreover, what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action?	4.247966012368125
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament 's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.	3.8343070889226962
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.	3.2198541187655074
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction.	4.63427242362573
That concludes the vote	3.171674280989757
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	4.40915910034342
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government.	4.881616275072906
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997.	3.672951556077691
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion.	4.529751310437851
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	3.9950138970952698
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.	5.973514765501788
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	4.018208029354822
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	4.861513370954777
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	4.811830722742972
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	5.383308548646324
This model function also applies to regional cooperation.	4.7524922909812375
This is not new.	3.5293554387758452
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	3.6666115171570484
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];	2.0333568280417604
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	3.444673023066206
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	3.132708271683178
This goes against the Commission ' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	3.98100996610897
Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests.	2.986746231055514
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.	4.232370790310763
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	3.6811519048606614
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.	2.91823993293727
We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable.	4.350951087684487
Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation.	3.5025439583077262
The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments.	4.365374493089151
In a fortnight ' s time, I shall be in Berlin.	4.221381616247527
They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale.	3.068950200815493
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	3.467999877700841
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.	5.17551662238763
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit.	4.246997911517814
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2472483132960324
Report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)	1.967951164182699
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.	2.810154932303519
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	2.2157840627727783
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments.	3.4226926750880864
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	3.744821709834968
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	3.2766660659597333
Congratulations!	1.994122001244139
Of course they do, but they are not unlimited.	4.0959538042489
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	4.891647988679376
Flora Brovina ' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.	2.569618444327369
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	4.902841561386043
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	2.9537242200504945
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	4.921370314132984
Second, there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism.	3.181330956568438
In common with Mrs McCarthy, I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced.	5.075265558218756
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial.	3.4045486863579977
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.	3.2710263667795645
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is.	3.9745119311576063
In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997.	3.9190778220209466
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%!	4.063578443531356
For the reasons set out above, I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax.	3.303148600645781
I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union ' s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.	4.899724345968701
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	3.239586373733672
From that standpoint, Aphrodite ' s island, as Cyprus is known, and the pirates ' island, as we islanders say of Malta with great affection, are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay.	3.175758240565043
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland.	4.245915054131888
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture.	3.153473488740118
There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union ' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts.	4.605800621668028
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU ' s next round of enlargement.	3.1611495383106227
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again.	6.127449383872643
There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks.	4.922617007683272
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten 's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	4.516519320083271
In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today.	4.154292647587652
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey ' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara ' s position on this.	3.974917470676596
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.	4.868853480303564
Relating to Amendment No 6	2.675778986618905
Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III.	4.201820055109116
The WWF reports that, according to Italian, French and Spanish customs authorities, illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase.	3.5360840788764762
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people 's health, particularly in the case of small children.	3.8775192550914985
Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie ' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year.	5.16571684519471
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.	3.4678482426438033
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January.	4.700125438539833
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.	5.399854073794192
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	4.076473127156453
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	5.765319644820101
This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission ' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States.	3.8251799816019063
The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation.	4.446914139209727
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	3.9449100763022433
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one.	5.689721748583848
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people ' s health.	4.398177236528029
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.	3.5703091307035097
Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive ' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive ' , hinders implementation.	3.1052956641744274
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	3.8539018229957223
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research ' context.	4.631957121854848
Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month.	3.007957439289832
Madam President, as you know, the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors, particularly in the French version.	4.021281328717882
We are discussing coherence here.	4.515464917112874
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.	3.6000303108222873
With regard to the environmental impact, it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions: pollution, over-fishing, changes in climate, etc. It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock.	3.1854565508324595
Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too.	4.736760244552656
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.	4.409856503286506
This has a certain semiological value because the Mediterranean and its islands - and I too come from an island - are the area which most of those who come from northern Europe for their summer holidays get to see, as well as the people who live there.	4.437976386628916
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union ' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union ' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view.	4.585118836317781
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability.	5.00070536547124
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.	4.1386630946424035
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission ' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.	4.362303578210572
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	4.04230706537127
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	3.3934582405436777
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .	3.573796908865856
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission ' s programme.	4.566512133663186
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.	3.9280881908522307
Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda.	4.799766846641633
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things.	6.001366176947096
As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session.	3.783978191612983
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House.	3.9805575596723997
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.	5.971652551609845
Cuba ' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle.	3.2967999654272977
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.	5.473667541661087
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	3.0643311327416245
This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend.	4.8550133404336595
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission 's accountability to this Parliament.	4.451294171463622
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out.	3.167201112141909
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.	3.5265180538830876
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	3.8947377467245237
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon.	5.217908052685766
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.	3.645717652994264
Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us!	2.359047487408684
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	4.261236589309381
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	3.123590732602537
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration?	3.699505994601497
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	3.4850684918116057
And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region.	4.400011775822611
We really hope and believe so.	4.664411195396149
The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly.	4.259246059038239
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana.	5.036273588398505
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields.	4.143230522180846
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	3.4790326099525046
We could not agree more with the latter.	3.0532308034585687
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	3.4283715033900717
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats.	3.276489293206289
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document.	4.009616473244966
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	4.246064112353164
In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important.	4.372470211984662
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	4.239609314602441
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities, non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces.	4.373979916836372
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is.	3.497494747425167
I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation, but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles, created by what Alan Greenspan calls irrationally exuberant markets, burst.	4.2647999651557456
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission.	4.376781206074579
This is an extremely risky strategy.	5.309112693623398
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.	3.5070472274203746
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe.	5.626037078060269
Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets.	3.9280784985653865
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.	4.110945758318741
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.	4.97843641167518
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this.	4.170063233556385
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.	4.354737932115763
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	4.846113100677194
Firstly, we need to make the EU ' s development policy more effective.	4.336386029190107
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.	5.155021645082113
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.	3.7113585978171226
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	4.248859098756428
There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment.	4.206031766093506
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.	3.6477531773402445
This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general.	3.7614643868340805
As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries.	4.127243108458235
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.	3.5579892186061675
These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union ' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment.	4.520793210493803
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.	3.852626292915754
Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe.	3.6818268420767892
I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system.	3.4323993265105988
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	4.269654890706629
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments.	5.9780888008766215
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty.	4.251216875187811
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north?	2.772440065678522
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	3.1163470916755696
You have one minute each in which to ask your question.	3.557246217059511
Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission 's determination to make progress serves as a model.	3.866375946708105
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	3.5678628287451386
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	3.2253194556281266
Well, I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information, and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it, then we will have bad decisions.	4.4737354985799955
The Mediterranean, particularly in some zones, is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value.	4.442721809658716
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.	4.220060140835598
This is what we should be concerned about here today.	4.039743981232068
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory.	3.3352676820082015
Finally, once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed, we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment, as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House. In this strategy, young people and women, training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention.	4.306080851390452
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	3.2520197934664266
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.	3.6715562736032754
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on.	4.150260422834285
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	4.130260469989845
In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment.	4.322695103328964
The Commission ' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.	3.552148940229641
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.	4.980347578501512
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe.	5.005338396695842
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism ' s contribution to job creation.	3.330635484139294
Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted.	2.9273794422197827
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste.	4.10290060554191
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	3.287314267907724
I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.	4.042843405668178
Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal.	3.936169400925577
The first concerns the manufacturer ' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles.	2.98307245061124
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	3.6201958339525606
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said.	4.971125540830675
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	4.561011334890124
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	3.460726557071821
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.	4.691712966688231
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card ' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	3.4169014135257934
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.	3.6229939556032313
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	4.762600955125064
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.	3.754364696420783
All this is important.	2.7628136226068496
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.	5.923834878748941
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.	5.530025600184544
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	4.33666501121719
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy.	4.4595129553762085
However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	3.8617596348901913
However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive.	3.6604673420738836
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	4.933169278543507
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms.	2.5696278504229846
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.	4.857999025791747
(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.7079857205784754
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations.	5.093525695880451
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	3.683597239642164
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	4.307910367886821
The European Union ' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council ' s conclusions or in any other statement.	4.066262444618605
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency, then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market.	4.446670683653505
Mr President, in a world such as this, which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic field, our responses, in order to be effective, must be concerted and coordinated.	4.443193090061365
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.	4.619703452900441
In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present.	4.0790936738785195
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	4.307582730501485
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.	3.871559210261305
Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service.	4.417515368443217
This is why this report is so important.	3.4892141046105984
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.	4.294345942511984
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.	2.6467951105401335
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	4.074570760867726
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	3.1860428813048842
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	4.634674583466182
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	4.153521197163663
I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House.	4.511848181190849
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur.	4.893402634869222
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	5.015207844503795
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides.	2.739027210120319
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement.	5.25110500054635
Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets.	2.3175310694085303
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	3.466403099629741
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability, as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us, is the result of speculation.	3.6483503450766723
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.	3.3142342197229535
This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.	4.1806894753222785
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	4.010085903200229
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.	3.3955981356731426
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence.	3.307254046360417
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	4.808258103272907
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	3.5831557358327686
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	5.848943088426136
(Parliament adopted the resolution)President.	2.60310777932207
We are all aware that, to this end, it is essential for the Council to approve, as quickly as possible, the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing.	4.321040961245635
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes?	3.1062286627202913
It is therefore important that the manufacturer ' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	4.301193630003162
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life.	3.420906234846334
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	2.9058817890768824
As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.	3.5433095033036124
It groups them together and that is very important.	6.10123742190573
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports.	4.717467142155014
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	5.354885484310593
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.	3.5384670115096917
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.	3.9490051034737546
The investment needs to be visionary.	8.409447025623543
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	4.484167883101754
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges.	3.8335122130777077
Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland.	3.483743683841087
In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union ' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context.	4.598059844180775
Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries.	3.4328515970840066
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.	4.426064829514399
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	3.1017339561651425
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.	2.963970276042123
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	4.260834340481424
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	3.4641379383315574
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal, and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC, SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal, is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries, in areas such as education or health.	4.102893292404917
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane.	3.144015777164178
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.	4.601649727939275
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.	4.227736527404451
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	3.0800251298452097
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	3.774796304321013
The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal.	4.688995419796405
The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement.	4.275871839097922
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.	4.483203993279404
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice.	3.3251280309449043
Fourthly, technically speaking, this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control.	3.4584475418773075
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	2.298807249230937
Mr President, I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on Budgets, and the Commission, and we can assure you that, for our part, we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties.	4.4838676245186235
Mr Rübig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well.	4.14404046489642
How is it envisaged that the EU ' s institutions, which are already stretched well beyond their capacity, can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition?	3.4259567619487346
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.	4.387226949661796
That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people.	4.201778067147822
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable.	3.614322935891498
This seems to me to be a workable solution.	5.702159468925892
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	3.480358333642628
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself.	4.275930661409013
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.	2.7269657943829926
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	2.673902558187525
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	3.1150358076246927
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: "Reforming the Commission" .	4.393872956145207
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy.	4.44890474791228
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	4.092183760418876
We have arrived at the final question.	5.066158125391117
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau ' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	4.0248593383651
Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications.	2.6122779524608424
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission.	4.524008225806352
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	3.8988123488325312
In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks.	4.0995749438936855
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.	4.780865509462985
In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.	4.056942146426132
It is an imperative.	4.548694514273439
During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union ' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers ' incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.	4.445299325443288
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and to thank all the Members who, in their various committees, have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.	3.599201921729577
VOTE	1.083590840144401
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament ' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all.	3.575294823122182
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	4.330528183386689
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	4.834405742680885
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas.	3.412831534042674
Lastly, there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière ' s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual.	4.672209855325475
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.	3.5726092468621613
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.	5.330227247652944
Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years.	4.025532793163855
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels.	3.1002264439612883
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution.	3.3060590579525098
During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved.	3.7354854980405
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost.	3.9665256816897907
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	4.208186824907226
We will therefore vote for the Greens ' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	3.7771388337384253
It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible.	3.4880668827608043
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.	4.31653298555364
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	4.791598589325682
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	3.9680512613540855
Let us make ourselves heard!	3.3823971155434296
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union ' s foreign policy.	3.818951975053197
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.	2.7968783905671
The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text.	4.114422914371966
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	3.761340492482053
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.	4.722408042282493
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	4.256526808936427
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	3.6702772660228082
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported.	4.786399469587714
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	3.114614971586387
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	3.3413903111121916
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	3.054183869300109

It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	3.5894481781636145
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable.	3.621205072436623
Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty.	3.6772676974723795
We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.	4.146576540962473
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	4.427759516630905
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations.	3.6579180443481465
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	3.5371844790287916
(Applause, heckling)	1.938182284654249
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	2.799867516483795
We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal, and that of course includes scrapie.	5.006693077608606
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	2.908485453669938
. (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments?	4.567864897961531
In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	4.611196903974516
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	4.269214009167388
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.	4.209086453430222
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.	2.8947739995997077
Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations.	4.189829400405734
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	5.356495609544236
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.	3.693789947122115
Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999.	2.6345534246689777
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned.	4.403577881548909
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	4.6281462442753645
Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had.	3.2716707917465437
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	5.105929392664726
75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions.	4.1358384265650345
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.	4.402376942243507
Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council ' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions.	3.7990306850432045
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	4.372257806264332
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.	3.6535915801559793
No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses.	3.592663197309414
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.	3.8581300766238815
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.	3.6883801452003877
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount.	5.229510367592057
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend ' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	5.009511780599714
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	3.6683780597913214
Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health.	2.956722477952978
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.	3.871303304188401
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	4.1843905989344465
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	3.904500550555669
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	4.017679553097686
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe.	2.930875060590981
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique ' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.	3.9318381381127288
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	3.1900875382772673
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.	3.2015633171881728
The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.	4.880334520380418
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.	4.550196738388613
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	3.393256231059038
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament, and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests, but also of business.	4.395272400967816
A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	3.391722709840677
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation.	4.750918424612135
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	4.262586313872492
You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better.	4.066761233891789
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	3.4660000893446963
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party.	4.6285445232039555
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	4.8081091706890255
Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible.	3.1919611403325705
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	4.687264317547547
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	4.536431056126283
Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice.	4.008692460985257
In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States.	3.400583070596813
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	3.4308300564591963
My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.	4.413224215341576
Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement.	5.898388979364676
	1.0363974359942942
It is not easy, indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing, that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties.	4.271694850565878
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole.	4.47793623659144
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are, in turn, generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious.	2.8481143460684177
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	3.7453389349923465
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.	4.262639208839847
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.	3.6276625651833525
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	3.341007501058025
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	3.470575461835893
The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission ' s opinions on the amendments under discussion.	4.423933842240376
Mr President, I almost feel like saying, "Phew" , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work, and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.	4.820231713594742
It plays down one of the Treaties ' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions ' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.	5.564424548005609
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.	3.8209849693059996
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	4.293824799720769
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office.	3.807731656726785
In this field the Commission, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.	4.790626847818593
As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes.	6.107344904488323
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.	3.660824945259152
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	4.063873438618431
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.	3.572576105614257
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.	3.7766440886650323
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament.	3.9846084443895124
This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world.	3.3570242610400216
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.	3.6452210158841387
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	4.276735994592877
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD).	2.0505763592201505
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today.	3.9695745265370097
Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.	4.478765406865536
We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia.	4.015638418174245
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.	4.545712028212157
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne.	4.114805074371556
However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people.	4.0279282959816305
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises. What we have here, first and foremost, is an incredibly ominous mixture of power, arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union.	3.933989760588451
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	3.6852369605416118
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.	3.645102066119368
It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor ' s Office instead.	4.43634895308653
(The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.6688069022930805
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	3.9602768791181444
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us.	4.672078028797618
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides ' surrendering power.	5.481017365778913
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.	3.786534019112709
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	4.774007616976534
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	3.509563999290571
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	4.3095173079935325
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000.	3.627900530873368
I think we need to retain it.	5.367350599191139
By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying ' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.	3.9017623419271192
In this sense, I share Commissioner Patten ' s positive attitude.	3.5520263489373027
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty.	4.321446302329503
As far as Mr Papayannakis ' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	3.110471898353393
Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped.	4.538137226633837
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.	3.219278665240908
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	5.532730159926068
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	4.500210360931915
That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected.	4.2572910874328755
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation.	4.374151169682006
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.	4.42571316025525
The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world ' s most important reserve currencies.	4.317280806187227
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	4.80228651150534
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes.	3.0907320324366068
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed.	4.985042393849514
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	5.728999171528711
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	4.479011745509897
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account.	6.084869688643627
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	5.093911182037663
To set my fellow Members ' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women ' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	3.6431717965491615
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	6.269455738120786
But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107.	1.991265778482823
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision?	3.6234668080114356
But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised.	3.0941365911406913
We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey.	4.730951267727949
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	3.2879471895308483
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.	3.242192026364376
Unfortunately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer.	3.546767542733314
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment.	3.6036071705372907
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today.	4.562692005371759
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider ' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a "Europe of shopkeepers" .	3.9974777702330524
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.	4.371592489979927
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections.	3.3213840383019226
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.	3.771847925467814
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.	4.796909333606214
(FR) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for a "constitutional process to be launched" .	4.201398687712856
As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate.	3.0419216038935533
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe.	3.1212633200745037
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	4.998026834148097
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	4.171150294169785
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature.	3.514261754484097
Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.	3.092379701186826
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision.	3.6607262304021964
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.	4.1993834370316785
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)	1.9365631477736889
I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning ' s discussion.	5.978148146108573
Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen ' .	4.0592465479944595
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter ' s report.	3.189108582152941
With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive.	2.993767277711009
It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today.	4.559586298905731
So again, rhetoric and reality.	3.228635114954768
Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as well as the amended version.	3.845291915579112
Thirdly, we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention, how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively.	3.0485910922334214
As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months.	3.9726991708252415
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me, is not enough, in practical terms, to allow any type of project to be carried out.	3.118429487410224
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report.	2.685345393597388
This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU ' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark.	3.8616134501503034
Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict.	3.8720507574335645
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.	3.9988269936620626
Should we not be discussing this issue?	2.148756091965019
Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising.	3.3640739037650786
My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus.	3.3866285740945434
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	5.309015771460869
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.	3.7386698853001477
I am not, personally, a blinkered militant in favour of monopolies, whether public or private, but when I see the results achieved by private firms in this sector I am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service!	3.728497596761609
We have been told how, currently, people 's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.	4.033622111734852
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.	3.638079654066625
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	3.4973429896513397
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.	3.249900197459773
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	4.27615394817331
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	3.9229581047310775
With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties.	4.300911458781972
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	3.8235155877880103
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.	3.6561036857096485
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	4.913502576186182
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.	4.275577037390434
This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April.	4.692980675572695
In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned.	3.7972823862590346
Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report.	2.939791410983135
Surely Assad would be Barak ' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.	3.3378746779251083
Question Time (Commission)	2.045435526911663
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.	3.3590987499990694
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	3.4013018175282625
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU ' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider ' s electoral success.	4.599152900010974
The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster.	4.516544243001988
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission ' s offices for several months.	3.910925793829597
We are losing market share.	5.049262836324092
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.	3.4727813600663358
I propose that the EU ' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated.	4.947709010809692
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated.	4.507868417245379
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region ' s multi-ethnic nature.	4.468861092279192
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):	3.176456337104444
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	5.045595037175362
For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country.	3.666599833665137
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.	2.8859930401861353
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	4.216218670095165
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	3.633754916899328
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	3.904511201345929
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments very carefully, and in particular to the rather emotional comments about Cyprus, especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus, which the European Union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.	3.4468813285878466
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.	4.440886722409135
What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat.	3.703994602971725
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	4.67758601464108
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	3.656272338960268
On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more.	3.756989169842161
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	3.526883610191936
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project.	3.9030063437098104
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification.	4.350227260026738
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	3.303785520239621
Secondly, speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify.	3.6474808401980985
As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.	3.7000486943395017
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	5.144816455222503
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.	3.418983676873326
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.	3.847171692086356
The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.	3.689839273887801
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market.	3.872357009709611
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	3.3684375797473547
We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead.	3.4595689704736388
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.	3.8625176998661885
This should first of all stand for better service.	5.138127400558609
That is important, for at least three reasons.	3.868713937191211
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe.	3.801169982524609
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.	3.2233257646438953
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	3.827406410014663
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	3.7087582121725413
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	3.5655146041436065
But all is not lost.	4.403944725240326
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	4.941233328278764
This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China ' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States ' initiative.	4.827217505551917
The next item is the joint debate on:	2.1404424566687466
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?	3.377342917177181
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	3.9263197794334714
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.	4.185996211910609
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.	3.7377680791996557
This is part of the solution.	5.049165148407673
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	3.8871265883434414
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.	4.228988141561721
Overall we have a system which has made some progress.	4.008987328006575
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle ' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	3.4732322542535914
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria.	3.3090044939600096
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found.	3.3987352862717852
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	3.3988339404915906
This is a true example of the Council ' s indifference towards culture, despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance.	4.6689733407617435
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	4.842152522583384
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision.	4.8938904258769576
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	4.174341220008423
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten ' s report.	2.9594693420898235
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	5.509079565379653
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions.	4.2758644935621595
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	3.9858859717125044
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region 's very scarce water resources.	4.348311150564278
Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity.	3.7934835616144618
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	3.0886302611896332
By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.	3.811976707557099
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.	5.196396012335423
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years ' time.	3.1409515971305257
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200.	3.6511260505502734
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	3.0726519370250878
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.	4.663190347787156
All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area.	3.7599828026151636
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	3.947292097068538
The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary.	3.910472397712534
Madam President, I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning.	3.617993382425916
I wholeheartedly agree.	7.810540199023855
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	4.512354082540126
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	2.599676087081765
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	4.570862841194664
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	4.810025513427131
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power ' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.	3.6977295447377094
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	5.357212454053803
The Union ' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	4.062816107323565
This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for.	3.4936338532486824
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation	6.697841740431705
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	2.8908705211666414
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.	2.8139010904504667
The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending.	5.042597695953445
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	3.3698543906159086
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with.	4.153322868005799
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	4.117626143959395
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	3.7446359654030745
Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth.	3.2677128178667165
- (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.	2.217548370516976
These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.	4.601855994743601
They will look into the matter thoroughly.	4.562755629241493
What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism?	3.206860934859393
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible.	4.16218078437459
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States ' arguments.	5.028346062650156
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	4.2449421995518035
I do not believe that it is anybody ' s intention to do so.	3.3174759459642904
First, by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly, as recommended in the Corrie report, thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged (regional economic partnership agreements).	3.3723115034606983
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.	3.707372707579242
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.	3.3187811057594487
The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field.	3.3099218301542668
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.	3.0952666122631336
The Council ' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling.	4.442817696941539
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)	1.9451468837011094
However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources.	5.237172547000398
Change in the law is fundamental.	2.636854567372478
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	3.502743004630675
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.	2.7725060011610476
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates.	3.761022649393682
So when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchanges of information, particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution.	4.350681976357906
Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.	3.69327304193029
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span.	4.041692457955133
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely.	4.15104429346765
. (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.	4.459423562391156
The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats.	3.6767634327725034
On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government.	3.5170508058033207
Financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	3.458621430762624
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back.	4.265706099987194
However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.	3.506676922815054
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	3.361460868472477
I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.	4.105845595363732
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.	3.8727698352260584
Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy.	2.8409240108328646
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	3.603740084461964
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects.	4.218533977010392
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.	7.986884809638563
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.	3.5007627623273154
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	3.317583657613099
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence.	3.9382219668952407
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	4.309727568793059
It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London.	3.2171472179692917
The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing.	3.942689701464474
At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties.	3.556001687968964
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.	4.610587323672586
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.	4.6268254594937845
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	3.784951728377005
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers.	2.918276257065614
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	3.33546945538214
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position.	2.5263185454366783
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020.	3.4559327595054805
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends ' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.	2.7610148239534786
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.	2.9494244204095064
Mr President, what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today: an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals?	4.084936880008854
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	3.946767859810165
That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little.	3.2865982873723287
But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	5.2831019040614695
These have been the most important moments in the Council ' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	3.7305609320174336
They have a much wider responsibility.	4.1274972019594065
For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law.	2.9642494661233343
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.	3.2876476670997
It could have sunk anywhere.	4.80277433563897
I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change.	3.5446290583837983
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	4.246679166872866
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties.	4.813177724443203
Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis.	3.965431550417243
What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation.	4.303090340150132
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	3.8258765397104226
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.	4.407087589391218
This is no longer tolerable.	2.9943534408868597
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence.	3.681645466198748
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	5.840070516363057
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits.	3.57237172573046
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	5.882461364721487
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?	3.8260302659862058
As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law.	3.7497981335929693
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	3.7001847473095797
I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do.	3.929091308882356
Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism.	2.6216431303475622
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means.	3.2790080823829473
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?	4.051888862876644
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	3.781927328326278
Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.	4.298498622259008
The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.	3.2881568602164286
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin.	4.359709689562985
B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,	2.496387586313852
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	4.1658569042633635
If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.	4.160466500057261
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	3.251759681348662
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.	3.5154062856901245
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	3.799749617485125
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	4.888118746334602
Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union.	3.6064839852194983
As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings.	4.542983828125957
As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification.	5.676532647784574
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.	3.463175208923765
This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem.	5.7526367961390825
In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid.	3.7465359949417443
On the same day, I understand, Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead.	2.8988723793784676
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.	3.8198491766003575
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	4.12554580244032
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage.	4.135770975154886
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	2.6210655721971867
Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe? ' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage. '	3.6024979823132477
II. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (9614/1999 - C5-0167/1999 - 1999/0805(CNS)	2.132805763890302
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech.	4.102975824827849
Furthermore, 90% of businesses active in tourism are small or medium-sized, the very enterprises which form the living cells of our social and economic tissue, which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development.	3.72004713779706
I passionately defend Europe ' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	4.421446915345287
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.	4.222604299946917
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.	6.2242032717849645
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.	2.0632560290608737
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	4.535657903442117
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	4.143314846156143
The disease is always fatal.	6.210727522321868
I am glad to see that the Commission and Parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area.	3.5883383427042443
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	3.30827034987295
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	4.055768282055695
Are we ready to pay for those resources?	3.836811586248228
In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm.	4.026299175029523
Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.	3.39196022053618
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	4.5868176126992495
I condemn Jörg Haider ' s racist and xenophobic policy.	5.03192704092806
Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.	3.6912240268542
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.	4.349431823421086
Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation.	2.8899449525323266
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	3.4263346053276447
It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden ' s.	3.1881812099914137
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	2.7314931029420744
You may answer the question.	3.3592332629786705
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull ' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	3.462644342183984
I would first of all like to focus on quality.	3.764396040086245
First and foremost, we need to compete in terms of quality.	5.219272514993905
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.	3.7491135057180696
Very well, I shall do so.	2.405145970683408
The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it.	3.7997142533683883
We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights.	3.914838713144299
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	2.9819881270547004
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	3.9366578089129916
Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field?	4.263229152398054
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	3.837544895314485
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	5.153082962791617
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	7.310354110270345
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	3.7802701658480364
Madam President, the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions.	5.166664968635612
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway.	6.145076625897463
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	4.5439779463739605
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	3.692707149270574
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe ' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.	3.2931702718494926
So further thought is necessary.	3.5017083631780186
The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)	1.9770552962376489
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	4.4632096715608895
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.	4.467978988640238
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	3.700167258807376
These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention.	3.6796855356972595
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.	3.9968393501949873
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.	4.5622185463095155
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	2.860564178270614
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?	4.780373134697457
We are also committed to the Security Council ' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.	4.576239437323563
I believe we can learn something from this.	4.110799214274747
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean ' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	4.383073505074142
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission.	3.9086957690147037
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.	4.184286432942595
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches.	4.680007785409249
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources	1.8423156187068097
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	3.2070700577524356
Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.	4.3931088814163815
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one ' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	3.563357235936281
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	4.827282327994319
Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental.	3.4146762372956725
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	3.5318697029434456
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	4.789580231880998
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	3.653688963172297
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.	3.69602028344762
Thank you, Minister.	3.3542295462137597
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted.	5.344026919698599
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind.	4.46017853994142
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?	3.3116558973121615
You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States.	4.481293885125518
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	4.259807722444152
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	4.5838874531324745
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	4.387239780702736
We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically.	4.692390930320082
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	4.553712784605359
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending.	4.815029454185542
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.	2.4907151106205077
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	3.3166953803929675
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato ' s report receives more support.	4.585185414686837
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.	4.502941727588887
Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions.	3.2972275877870167
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	4.142431342690358
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	4.151048140216742
Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on.	4.29485936781345
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	4.645091207820037
What about the infrastructures?	4.948554233144782
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.	3.107701188950465
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	2.959420218208454
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	3.3728855293063553
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	4.167967355730593
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure.	3.9260426373476816
Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party.	3.2211416369078476
To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced.	2.7925732097529257
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.8005890760472703
Mr President, I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up.	3.3456078749538323
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	4.285248571250497
There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment.	4.048105045593417
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.	3.496330093127637
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola.	4.020426736647724
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.	4.003165962602092
Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions.	2.595212342452109
I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it.	4.4063488546277485
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	4.677654994525714
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	2.626080023778924
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	4.0016464969625005
.	1.3940351656188106
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	3.965141241335054
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.	4.494097434094119
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.	3.188105518057111
Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)	2.1034833313381958
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	3.4432471760210106
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations.	4.8816225388499905
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.	3.9543693748709603
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	4.51528133766193
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	3.4542861212249703
It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds.	3.3905989435603443
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs.	3.6120658246916175
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	4.086445562343102
As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos.	3.5149704773802797
Do we have any figures?	2.9488414973207546
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	5.384701651042812
I think we should give this some thought.	4.880033506091246
Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law.	3.320694265254688
It would also appear to be in the Union ' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.	5.076812404495843
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme.	4.173854032958089
Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries ' .	3.3412801894889705
Furthermore, it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water, between different river basins, practically impossible in the future.	3.082187098321485
.	1.3940351656188106
Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe ' s role in the world.	3.811640775487555
Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry.	2.538751739738245
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe.	4.052700358383526
- (PT) Mrs Korhola, as you will understand, I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply.	4.987938630062178
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	3.112264515444853
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament.	3.660648096586207
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	4.098620837769973
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.	3.8600026104914322
Mr President, Commissioner, since the issue of employment has been raised, I want to recall another issue which is also very serious, namely the bankruptcies among Tour Operators and their consequences mainly for hotels, which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are trustworthy.	3.6300276320747304
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.	3.8188447787550737
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	3.54503783847057
By focusing the Community 's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States.	3.009641442371173
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	3.5387871635609227
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	3.4767832241419416
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.	3.666227464766823
This is all I can say.	3.350683495550127
In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament?	3.5450494032517343
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries.	4.326639385383808
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days.	3.000623800891096
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.	3.159499891434461
This is a key priority for us to focus on.	4.574636302657206
Of course, the story of the Erika seems comical.	3.7474153435397883
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?	4.020337133029414
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,	2.6959545029607535
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.	4.710547859267926
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	4.118742796170424
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed.	3.997640609514578
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	3.5081114193779546
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.	3.277397672449502
We should not be too masochistic.	5.191427544677303
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.	5.802171012520131
In this context, a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open.	4.417705059308201
Parliament ' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union ' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.	4.348085530017143
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results.	4.128848078308398
Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position.	3.5980399721278986
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.	3.2789914226716803
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference ' .	4.046428347131028
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years.	3.10498304732079
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.	4.394319879270641
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements.	5.007031010620148
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.	3.6159316606271545
At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.	2.794083552650045
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe.	3.116685608335322
I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said.	4.947343522407668
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	4.046449336995275
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	4.289837889945642
However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President.	3.8808711760156895
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	4.324041865177417
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.	5.0339848081532965
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	3.6360546082221337
Today ' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed, and one which I welcome.	3.7644194581871724
This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa.	3.2804348802595342
Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity.	4.499717877656582
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	5.525593938087848
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN, is it not about time you abandoned your traditional, conservative views on refugees and immigrants?	3.5117855291306186
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998.	4.586157405071323
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	4.1520048931008775
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer ' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?	3.8774600953946545
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.	4.503467130552657
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	3.1808276659761856
I condemn this, as well as the Council ' s absence.	7.166413609279889
Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission ' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.	3.963232283160003
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.	3.8084343697766037
Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error.	4.6793329007512146
In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic.	3.7906163939814075
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.	4.738242218169918
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity.	4.806939192886579
There is a second issue I would like to raise.	3.863611954075123
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	3.7517150367851264
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.	5.7275249616417305
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production.	3.731176120027084
Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making?	2.9858118919466947
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.	4.160427456922951
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did.	4.512732292280682
Can you?	4.134172595728164
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.	3.9062411841721882
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.	1.8962128551746422
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.	4.853065523850276
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox.	3.528216925727188
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism, and not just the economic and financial policy experts.	4.2957197312563515
A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS).	3.102746418253075
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive.	4.2096857512309995
Briefly, these are the main points of the reform.	4.029192894137232
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.	5.420394553156964
Statement by the President	2.743044752932298
Questions to Mr Bolkestein	2.4267733096941475
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow.	5.223888060190428
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	4.009603609169277
Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission ' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament ' s legislative powers.	4.473009608572263
rapporteur.	1.7389090213199234
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.	4.1296845494562815
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	4.827720338969829
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House.	3.5309087994662844
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.	2.7716860702012
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.	4.465424813393986
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	3.5947221727324505
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time.	5.556889905799023
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?	1.9391447964158843
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	4.805277534539488
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	3.960540975267704
However, that is precisely what is happening.	3.3831595237185366
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position.	4.712435647798267
B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance	2.5804352923475578
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	2.7934735389754053
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences.	5.275975276157166
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	4.061293748533405
But above all, the human rights policy is too fragmented.	5.782222782590973
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.	4.328221002647391
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.	4.409461590643625
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%?	3.7597072684029107
It sets environmental parameters close to zero.	3.920246262585591
The denominations of the euro are well known.	6.326271292240493
For example, as they stand, the Commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	3.6952366256950673
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	3.287492410039784
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.	3.611532890933655
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.	4.529019166411174
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	2.899329081160284
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union ' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU ' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.	4.649848918914167
The German version is not very clear here.	5.85266260559426
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	4.8016397620089935
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	2.2246876772156776
It is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.	3.648702223856811
Mr President, the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals, notably, of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group, which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and, in my opinion, this version is an improvement on the original.	4.565474040182552
Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider ' s Freedom Party.	3.441324211141219
I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable.	4.1019408922270095
This is wrong!	5.48530049408679
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed.	3.5382712221485053
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	3.4027985272557113
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.	3.5666522643198166
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	1.3774216321043118
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	4.575695271143771
Report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 - 'Comitology ' (1999/468/EC)	2.955792953003792
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.	3.4930771234034355
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	4.05320632449873
Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?	4.40883005383392
First Part	4.319872631509531
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	2.879907530086611
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	4.474539267951432
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	4.17962117102586
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job.	4.53196726640204
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	2.92731648101953
We must improve information on all of the world ' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	4.518282016822644
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	4.125686541225
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	4.974000776382832
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	4.745225186667187
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe ' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	4.622414060286521
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes.	4.119276389129365
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	3.4388282572914224
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.	4.768435045601138
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	3.418711636005069
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	2.6127841724831216
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	2.489787238420079
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.	4.403142893453282
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	3.6062932332482363
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	4.3233961140128665
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	5.005005291672922
We will need the European Public Prosecutor ' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	4.055124489807149
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.	3.013626545100566
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.	3.834916866656309
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.	4.656149838971441
The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this?	5.232217348150896
The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way, but without forgetting public investment.	4.539392787701149
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	3.1611998748026218
The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.	4.5594361112767245
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.	2.4613050157742182
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.	4.934227390220683
This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace.	5.150092581856065
Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities.	3.189113625324268
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union ' s financial interests, and to OLAF ' s relationship with the national authorities.	3.5176863406680012
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management.	4.776325330802787
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	4.185335032754701
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today ' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	3.840625284880304
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne.	4.574200954330477
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	2.6938495171133896
For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.	3.3454126027880617
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	3.3214947968553834
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):	2.9436138392488904
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	3.6487883044106977
However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling.	3.5506890089955627
Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity.	3.3976577502671392
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.	3.8662484190273907
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote.	4.309964027965268
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."	3.773090407444036
It is obviously the Commission ' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	5.107943096419605
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	3.9156029906055787
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.	4.844542653522586
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data.	3.834118885966969
The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds.	4.013761898820861
In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union ' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallström has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan.	3.5822191037151545
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid.	3.4000069106938393
What guarantees are there of its reliability?	4.007323286881436
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	3.3256965321407126
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	3.418931744826739
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	3.5506960897099513
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	4.162062037690374
As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed.	4.537291532348476
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other.	4.390677471873725
My question to the Commissioner is this: what is to be done?	5.478228467785325
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	3.7341525548405117
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)	2.063612699035972
But I would rather like to say something else to you.	4.342980875456466
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	4.232300006967562
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.	4.1267076138558
Unfortunately, we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb, Romany, Turkish, and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next.	3.871600302909421
Mr President, in Kotka, in Finland, there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals, which is sailing under a flag of convenience.	2.8316379831843164
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission ' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.	4.658561366248292
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	3.5128074131622786
(PT) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas, such as NOW, on new opportunities for women, HORIZON, for disabled persons, YOUTHSTART, for promoting the labour market integration of young people, and INTEGRA, for groups threatened with exclusion. Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.	3.177876852784699
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.	4.989376841993827
There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe ' s tourism and, to the extent of the possible, safeguard the operation of companies.	4.597295873783999
I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved.	3.79305369861111
That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community ' s Habitats Directive.	4.675605136539181
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	4.223632455609993
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	3.5771087510620485
(Sustained applause)	1.7374337359860184
We are not talking about words here.	3.1833328752615846
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	4.93811495533892
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively.	3.458329126909076
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	3.932927770822423
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	2.4872658724895635
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition ' .	3.4016098417118896
It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.	4.078256637926833
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	3.3768855324829903
Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed.	2.717461466716101
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.	2.2986777990456413
It is quite logical, it is consistent!	4.049705815548506
However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive.	5.068712481529566
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	5.01155962460676
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.	3.8977280869834185
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson ' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	3.4418748404886705
However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State.	3.6992850871771443
It is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	3.4017874126570105
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.	3.4461367898654367
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation.	4.1787267178599805
It has no right to do so.	3.852646806128528
This is the crux of the matter.	2.2072256242165067
One of the programme 's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility.	3.6373930531957623
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.	3.9426985826442076
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.	3.0509715993695696
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	4.280562151732182
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and, in common with others, express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence.	4.05634089667353
The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products.	4.293392064614074
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.	4.739485495716329
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation.	3.9173205615922875
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	4.848274684325111
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness.	3.8584828450726376
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day.	4.547338077409337
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	4.455113747282883
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.	3.882985257749661
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.	4.602844674660301
I therefore welcome the Commission ' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie.	4.903551743485106
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.	5.212936684322222
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	3.349718122265355
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy ' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	3.8956423332839925
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.	4.079751595878777
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	4.220318360741302
In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future.	4.238901429791684
Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully.	3.3789645237072046
I do not agree.	4.6274984124786505
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?	3.9092750094155466
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.	4.257850708554955
The first is greater transparency.	4.407992167497028
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	4.1187278546448045
Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist.	3.9922570500043286
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	5.115269048147889
The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Asia, where there is greater opportunity for profit.	3.495499687436824
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.	4.178389070032344
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	4.609660914598188
That is important.	3.4476711996399003
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	3.8676077428141475
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament.	4.2813148859398495
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society.	3.2715262220255243
Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent.	2.4907209967202038

Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.	4.220745504127784
It is Europe 's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	4.1556818960752775

In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role . in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.

Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy.	4.353138170849826

In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants ' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital.	3.1652308572751733
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	3.818922484300351

A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS).	2.2041061895211658

We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.	3.45491832878002

These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	3.407617263584143
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	5.087336870806341
There are two reasons why we are saying no.	4.256262535086263
Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.	3.1619969829969783
As for the time scale demanded for the directive ' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive ' s implementation will take time and considerable resources.	4.120693843126267
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	4.698491336724367
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	3.2299895503438307
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.	3.3593521454176862
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	3.3897787658241367
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic.	4.856225868909411
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea.	3.9649416054250954
Secondly, it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries.	3.513462174573003
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	4.261451935190992
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	3.7677279873886595
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society ' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".	4.214025054045745
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	1.9820693753891654
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	3.0668547792558414
The rules for management companies, for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business, are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations.	4.285393759300079
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	3.4133035116059762
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	4.088652679496966
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	4.203650667484529
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens.	3.312528981574901
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner.	4.7349562837755395
The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	2.1901102488146846
This is the European Union ' s declared aim.	4.951220739279024
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.	4.205240627114021
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	3.97859704390037
This means that this proposal ' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.	4.935264430632444
As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives.	4.948693172627328
In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.	4.162111012516706
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.	4.443986951628067
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.	3.1829038829289176
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.	2.062576810532381
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission ' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century.	4.90721471964502
I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it.	4.092681201705753
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU 's financial support for less well-off regions.	4.316939693103102
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community.	4.251980134717457
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.	3.3817053649030937
Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union.	3.0335012252658795
Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido.	3.267550240378215
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.	3.8019222799573145
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.	5.036803892045717
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	4.218159219043606
We can therefore table only one additional item.	4.114731294909263
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	3.4945008956388373
We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.	4.898312602354054
This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold.	4.048263270837838
All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates.	5.5361568671365315
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	4.558477023447153
We need hard and fast rules.	4.4760284239530215
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech, 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, and a fundamental expectation, as from this year, that will be realised in the form of specific actions.	3.294613170902625
That is where the potential is.	4.097459884619339
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.	4.568794204627576
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.	3.7261484202006243
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.	5.286812233089243
But unfortunately, as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber, human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world.	4.106700086051162
I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started.	5.198783577274002
Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy.	3.4779465042641604
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.	3.9373995333922314
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).	5.7281138459628
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens.	5.334126408030672
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.	3.5405884703948294
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	3.5496394380003533
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	3.946341138520263
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account.	4.152440774320561
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz ' s remarks, and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom, security and justice, without having to derogate from their own powers.	4.627301471437006
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.	5.081558327267935
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	4.111952103485964
The matter is still open.	5.812089387834125
European postal services	4.389952436179444
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates.	3.6161088886128914
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	5.14466429301953
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	4.218863665454793
Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses.	3.311995895407303
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	3.2808069611010504
The Council 's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas.	5.291463194364663

We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	5.42776040070091
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament ' s proposals.	3.5704997619007663
. (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals.	3.367993066359166
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.	4.3143100663998935
The first is the issue of the media ' s influence.	4.483011942424648
Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!	4.2550445056368496
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!	4.212764336689811
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles.	3.8611712276591508

Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought.

In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa ' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU ' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	3.2786221307328174

The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential.	3.2668234473855113

I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.	4.440028274949234
And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	3.6037960329616805
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us.	4.351219638532082
Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999.	2.7703536446103088
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.	6.164993775848046
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	5.3519579273284865
Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.	3.8786995958646573
The bet before us is a bet with time.	5.021381607560485
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.	3.5014620151324345
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.	3.1167278906883245
In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	4.460724703379961
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour ' s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof.	2.9024867838659105
What is the Commission ' s verdict on this?	3.811990947519909
For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal.	3.1420578678003825
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	3.6858695936095764
Who pays for the collection, the dismantling, the disposal and so on?	2.8203283219388116
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	4.244283554138775
In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language.	4.222337551269182
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	4.050361593450242
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one ' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services.	4.416561561188605
No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.	4.252698620244366
Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union.	3.0072329843329637
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.	2.959799142510518
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.	3.4441653455567094
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about.	3.7873164527405
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	4.202439249856137
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.	4.40126350393826
. Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development.	3.858119869238451
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed.	3.857264885470028
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.	4.539598060807588
The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life.	3.5146737734766766
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	2.3922577602157293
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation.	5.352729091567172
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	3.5323149934464553
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	4.532602160543584
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.	4.479942873886843
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car.	4.3540252826203405
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.	3.312346063322144
During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model.	2.8640527466267995
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it.	4.208333081230966
For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars.	4.049122378156203
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak ' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements.	4.049193934878296
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed.	4.187314092987157
I endorse this view.	6.919036300908417
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish? '	4.1702270256883684
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.7079857205784754
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	5.007026807946935
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments.	2.9615247987428046
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.	4.0831791616379745
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	4.824453911351098
Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative.	4.195245972988503
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.	3.440582553722054
A single key is to suffice in future.	3.4443191296155633
We want a colourful Europe.	4.023979440563033
Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations.	5.0176867190055034
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.	4.73648100375684
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	3.298762445005742
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	4.55588987602753
I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity.	4.2680615367733195
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.	4.6856076834150855
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology.	4.80122843514779
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	4.318797805406399
Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level.	3.794599875664672
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes.	3.8826568048282715
Now, more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south, the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges.	3.674864943985815
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?	3.5105509901920753
Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon.	2.850561386935241
This too is unacceptable in my view.	2.800847014269139
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way.	4.0087577654715245
It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products.	3.5864863487037177
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	3.9008569739009915
This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission.	3.8640360503269737
Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on.	3.579546678065374
Forgeries are big business.	1.7637022189732092
Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate.	4.039733272713693
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	3.368781276797301
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	4.346517043859122
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.	2.766214900304777
In terms of human rights, this is a backward step.	4.670745756442049
We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and, what is more, concepts.	4.0633384728526805
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.	4.463670162031044
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above.	4.2196899808094805
I thought that it was quite superb.	6.534518070114983
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997.	4.629324147226154
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.	3.0215493677700165
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here.	4.304786526363713
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this.	4.339725464051089
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock ' s reforms.	3.64765018075988
Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place.	3.7310909705536726
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.	4.186626071722723
Why should we add to them?	2.7617840105631206
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	4.672426037318573
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	4.2565643223263585
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	4.757989665493462
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.	4.535718532033572
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.	3.3836519577446236
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	3.9873875402281116
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.	5.55489920755753
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	3.432407228503918
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented.	3.589534053564586
In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals.	3.806024371590523
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with.	3.547820448870703
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found.	4.448091082821402
Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services.	3.5535702888321308
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.	3.6082384577070914
In any case, the Commission ' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	3.6381254952621953
This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values.	4.2733461850691725
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.	4.877950306546372
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions ' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	4.396644681236049
Students are an obvious example.	1.972350958340556
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	4.201913666633268
Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group.	3.112754750646091
The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo, that is to say, to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States.	3.612890212004298
The ACP-EU agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption, by sparing those who are responsible: when will sanctions and controls be imposed on Total-Elf, which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the Congo?	3.8577298740632378
What is the Council 's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?	4.9790278983882095
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	4.373562273706118
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.	4.13571023101192
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	4.659266293087078
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable ' .	2.9318525257435937
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.	3.5731604505070367
The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year.	6.06335968587655
It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light.	3.596172747454165
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted.	3.8073397093426076
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	5.380825625882444
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.	4.033550455288846
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	3.9338253292351046
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	4.656267703284588
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.	3.9791275167330507
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.	5.828922267652296
They were treated like the worst criminals.	3.815393375545377
First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1).	5.226477983970698
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet ' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.	3.7706846600767356
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women.	3.2745329477325456
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community ' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	4.19165058029766
That is very much the right approach.	3.8826144530684057
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation.	4.557220558596871
They must be implemented without delay.	2.824685044507338
On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000.	4.612211536672491
You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come.	3.62200441605187
As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.	3.31420077861256
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	5.356260422826103
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building.	5.584197625304238
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.	3.7626097158209695
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	4.511002687338718
However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government.	4.151668121706922
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.	3.1137670118895735
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.	5.264063678158305
International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union ' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there. I am, to say the least, curious to know how they are getting on.	3.6895742678634993
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.	3.9751945849299943
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.	2.8015672739114543
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	4.3623081148374245
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?	5.941436919405751
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	4.629267039227534
There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies.	3.921100754496601
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	4.318931385193238
Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries.	3.8340878561467484
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things.	3.033844064941926
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems.	3.4925786625063986
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF ' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur ' s intention.	4.071848036480146
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.	4.651693042260857
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.	3.8043137470989428
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	3.822345905874671
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	3.3058710029700205
No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared.	2.966203757442091
Nothing has happened!	2.223947231524966
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	3.8395135994173955
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	3.6945289193526767
We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.	3.8837207738940753
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	4.133987301788265
Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework.	4.423469822752488
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.	3.694533074317891
The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted.	3.680284818359041
This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.	4.100187853010703
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.	3.253182752451806
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	4.11210005923024
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled.	3.4803280812143975
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval.	4.612277384785793
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	3.5815372649097386
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	4.608519593998138
That it is what we are doing.	3.6707592290645885
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.	3.6907323240138488
Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.	3.5125415239763296
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.	5.118592228146645
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	4.2610141891131486
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis.	3.603643861146278
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	3.7698836913891283
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	4.663057502573304
The EU ' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment.	3.329455227354842
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.	4.34847765903519
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget.	3.7226410392351585
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical, realistic and also achievable.	3.6377562272904487
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs?	3.008269503132928
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now.	4.364494876287949
We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender.	3.868457965218048
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.	4.084679204358378
The facts are clear.	5.940868297313522
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	3.5334811261069206
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	4.6586517382416455
The Commission ' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.	3.2217883326915615
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	5.3705149024945555
Reality is obstinate.	1.9921727419276225
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	3.143036644732476
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament ' s plenary sitting today that Europe ' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.	4.659217971327959
And there is no sign of this trend ' s being reversed.	4.391804732252238
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.	3.4676722638432436
I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart.	3.9336106097653976
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.	4.193932957769339
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	3.3298431743893007
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	5.072772918410101
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	2.693396034932195
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.	4.335311376170466
But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.	4.045744824203205
Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market.	3.4761869829980134
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period.	3.6073391675621798
. (FR) Mr Decourrière ' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.	4.568561145021688
As I said at the beginning, the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed.	4.73506533983536
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.	3.514919308507741
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.	3.2224932887962097
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms ' and 'structures ' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.	3.2724031109828795
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	3.9860916868918332
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	4.2680927183842465
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked.	3.4073143624954794
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.	5.224558323853478
For example, Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there.	3.5661704169801642
We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions.	3.9410210678270525
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause.	4.119964178225446
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	1.9155921359613184
The staffing system is too rigid.	5.932991636382538
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.	3.392342234625078
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo.	3.9508409905669644
) Mr President, I voted for the Council 's strategy for modernising social protection because, in my view, it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation, although it does not actually go the whole way.	4.02694909964802
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.	2.9981252120614763
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary.	3.8409050565395715
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	2.9485633544453904
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.	4.023208007757361
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	4.719390833070813
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects.	4.281190035522258
In our opinion, the Union ' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity, not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs.	3.849494477832965
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	3.3226371160852755
Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas.	2.9287187751125927
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	4.6981336202665505
On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs.	3.443027404788761
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	4.103930980189317
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.	2.633505196060247
I should like to raise three points which for us, as Members of the PPE Group, must be focal points when such an area is created.	3.9679687413295466
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.	5.143337697437698
Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream.	2.6863348356873438
First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years.	4.042388362113087
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	3.8151804019439517
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.	4.4991163805121435
I am, up to a point, concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.	4.59433142745072
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication.	3.9605909069304177
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	3.4947474214588174
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.	3.8697776550813736
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years!	3.7255692486702707
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	4.082296225194693
This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary.	4.524328118385269
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union 's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	3.672094122193753
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	3.620704877343545
Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple.	3.838796819578864
They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world 's population never making a telephone call in their whole life.	3.7551077936674915
I might never have studied otherwise.	4.947417866590113
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	4.425148525746039
We must put a stop to this trend.	3.8219784381486046
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.	4.923435632519096
In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN ' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen.	4.173829905789345
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	4.047120552531692
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	3.7194519876857592
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers.	4.376119257651688
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	2.4447370806451807
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).	2.6200790509910115
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	4.006608250984112
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	3.934026367560779
By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament ' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III.	4.323410781664015
Mr President, Mrs Attwooll ' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002.	4.8676592262132425
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	3.9927891033153577
Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action.	3.418062782201926
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	4.053868327060271
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge!	3.0953497833715975
The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community.	5.7243562366036755
Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.	4.259188522875635
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.	4.027706762257633
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.	4.212100606448213
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	3.855808259205465
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.	4.728169551275757
Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances.	2.5873752008328617
Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.	4.23781981653623
It is, in fact, something very positive.	4.998313514252592
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament.	4.669574021347485
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	3.5853922388930055
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.	4.334468427253671
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.	4.017769202127253
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.	2.427799017756518
The following spring to mind in this respect: the systematic collation of documentation and information, professional forms of observation, the development of information campaigns, the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned, a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy, such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like.	3.4700358215258866
Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	3.992283700095135
To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.	3.87463014814911
I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries.	4.020235132823724
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.	4.595980434834563
If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July.	4.082687270755393
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	4.996101202231054
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	4.126478052230768
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	3.687231801042703
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular?	5.675343504148009
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.	4.870439814072779
Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded.	4.937669950871962
But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation.	4.585382777838543
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development.	3.9419148393890646
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	5.041142558906021
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one ' s own interests.	3.872386107839328
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	3.5602622302546125
There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation.	4.29473882532268
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur.	5.46163778451509
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	6.123259599422239
Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said.	3.5226157205895383
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld ' s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed.	4.446688254973413
In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few.	3.917719133285774
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	3.361974427252439
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages, but have not been able to check all of these, and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type.	4.662206678070627
It is still not an insurmountable problem.	4.786971485060235
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	3.540263999207417
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern.	4.062152793162425
For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.	3.306319895268763
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	4.2346305994612035
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.	3.903513636457004
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	3.862711166870492
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	4.792741575488681
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	3.57644413797531
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.	4.329262261516757
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	4.013700493831948
The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union.	3.831225084307463
However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy.	5.226370360925193
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	3.4790658514629147
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.	3.8471302102781593
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can, in a few hours, cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country, plunging its whole population into recession.	3.6360240236897075
By definition, investment funds use other people ' s money.	3.598417849542591
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	4.117424017242374
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	4.388490706105696
However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	4.394164874250126
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.	4.100190524146436
The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean.	4.326491513253897
We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.	4.213895149366719
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation.	4.214194318535278
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.	3.5433456918947006
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued.	5.4255036590080765
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities ' historical and cultural role.	3.694409826292211
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.	3.21927601115255
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	3.50554522258822
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.	2.656076687143703
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds.	4.199748936078042
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	4.711966696626193
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report.	4.566661109910165
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	5.007845210040968
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria.	4.572962087868529
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.	3.907606482847194
The current situation is not good.	4.580065640033087
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	5.324842683629076
The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle.	4.568586497840949
It turned its threatened loss of power into an "heroic battle for the preservation of values" and an imminent, pure-and-simple "decision between democracy and non-democracy" .	3.0964031193511206
This is part of risk management.	3.8801175681223103
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	3.378586815114538
We also need to criticise the Commission ' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	3.746002667192644
It need only be fine-tuned.	6.070986977686371
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support.	3.5963204409947593
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF ' s job.	3.3216878785280133
How can those affected be compensated?	3.153142273608868
To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible.	3.8340324069450014
We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee.	4.7405592212279775
The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection.	4.795053647505441
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level.	4.853739942932332
As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.	3.5877800540991847
In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba.	3.874763474968934
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.	3.598391422212785
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State.	3.6456291744916016
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	2.0317371781454012
The Commission ' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding.	3.964814164106092
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet.	3.0997519886435674
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.	2.6524322977370134
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	3.7174080850582385
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is.	3.781051368735786
The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services.	4.872184605958819
Without them we would not be able to function.	5.990260774241562
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	2.6903776953777463
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate.	3.455760060823026
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	3.884986488573564
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?	2.85397774106139
I will willingly accept Madam President ' s apologies any time.	3.725267251722518
The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia ' s neighbouring states all the more.	3.449794356203439
Parliament ' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades.	3.450671742231721
In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners ' in all measures taken under the new CSF?	4.512367921763308
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!	4.2684431523316855
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.	4.626512655644986
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts.	5.204805242956969
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy.	3.783122719483755
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them.	4.859205152426694
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	4.3064056530508745
It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today.	3.4388046823453324
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	4.7963748850064825
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality.	3.7364747762574604
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.	3.8604889929259634
As a king sport fisherman myself, I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds.	3.0679484184261794
We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory!	3.782207957728946
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives.	3.7811975853594983
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	3.7438549916570123
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.	5.4751893770248685
The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff.	4.18189139688256
Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr Désir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.	2.992489713085915
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.	5.186335214655711
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report.	4.428602270879619
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood ' s remark.	3.3325725309642813
Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union.	4.09434449996195
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.	3.509177583715617
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	3.895116663832513
Representatives of the Council, within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament.	3.9367573031455207
The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections.	4.143035793045352
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	2.04409523449518
He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve.	2.6260869694054123
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency ' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.8697163363737146
(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean.	3.0947484286809415
They are wrong.	3.820532971134664
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.	4.469320044133566
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable.	4.182526475771697
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.	4.7600397776666
There should be no confusion in this debate. As environmentalists, we do not want an excuse for a motion.	4.290884322835867
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.	4.06997208628937
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	3.5844153497156253
I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce.	3.675036502143127
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	3.5586729597643134
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.	4.244158680499738
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.	3.8118847860499696
It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann ' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position.	3.8248501185739485
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.	3.160196400544056
However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater.	3.2226335325019617
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	2.8829139465149627
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.	3.6598634235411818
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.	4.076829202596981
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	4.74280728336525
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.	4.124373984141876
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card.	4.496944016672617
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home.	3.8889987905824355
I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.	4.434659867297419
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.	3.09608675128528
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	3.0445707121940297
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups.	3.7766319795509915
A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think.	3.112609110807071
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.	4.1605645826444855
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.	6.670268012385668
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone ' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	3.633257182474596
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.	3.3632030518473934
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	4.548764557611296
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	5.090310470654462
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication ' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	4.485691823940498
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.	3.5088941139615457
Mr President, I listened with interest to the Commissioner 's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market.	5.1513729310384795
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.	5.7398916165370455
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	2.3704550593366696
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.	2.9357535546017504
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.	3.1941234997551433
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.	5.010519777924788
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?	4.235840247868844
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.	4.203461091672141
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake.	6.768163467773726
Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.	2.9055159749243855
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	2.076572223121467
We feel that these issues result from the IGC ' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.	4.381469716978466
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation.	4.412812155428163
The approach that we have been following in these discussions, and our participation in them, essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist, based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate, and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found.	3.8689772792854944
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	3.1114282692933553
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	3.6570916909338718
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that.	4.58709453939194
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.	4.376119228584476
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.	4.077230799790544
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	3.4934155577547434
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	4.25292705131766
On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.	4.008875162561171
The Commission ' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging.	4.489862966021726
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	3.796743288106002
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State.	4.122024355558208
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case.	5.5436063376147375
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?	3.089466525609278
I suppose that the first thing they say will be, 'let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union ' .	5.332421449084229
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility.	3.9502458283669863
Protection of juvenile marine organisms	2.605210222976999
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.	4.0807506745134
Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe.	2.176469635818352
This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people.	4.112099487355307
Thank you for listening.	3.0074569650448737
Women deserve more than a quota.	4.410250593450142
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks.	3.585353591591744
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	2.7083038017038037
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	3.1821184356704775
In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed.	3.4037175675630125
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur.	5.231408407999758
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	3.6257875299712343
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	3.985557414991105
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.	4.82360146627247
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	4.53881615174743
This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy.	3.2886486854471
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.	3.4638323541641016
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	4.819121478403472
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region ' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.	3.3454141669483253
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.	4.466122670156584
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	5.483204585753817
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law.	4.684810999845012
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	3.436189566263407
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.	4.0581100628229745
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	4.669951114644363
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.	3.092431796491242
I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds.	4.481686881524642
Women are systematically raped.	2.7480038341688675
Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future.	3.725391819499632
I am certain, therefore, that an island such as Malta, with its population of 340 000 cannot accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater.	3.545650220789888
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	5.16785665157708
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR.	3.4935209870683983
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party!	3.598389983525529
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	2.8732975936149225
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	3.255947813232912
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter?	3.132273139559093
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams, even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue.	2.983223380850419
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission.	3.9966135119371113
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	4.356496360728361
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki, so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion, including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests.	4.976478835945193
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means.	4.7071447925085055
The situation of Turkey 's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy.	4.029733777539657
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission ' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	3.8162003265529427
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.	4.533982637472317
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council.	4.075249487675548
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods	2.257470523485572
However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be.	3.7819377127643694
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.	3.9361346720002848
Tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage.	3.586469921070801
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	3.6602218731300993
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.	4.774375822020939
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations.	3.862598246923992
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	4.030831345328131
If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free.	3.620993158200073
	1.0363974359942942
In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view.	4.949762308653073
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	4.422540792101393
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!	2.9744923773400656
I would like to finish off with this observation.	3.0982385300450908
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and we believe that on the basis of work already done, it will be possible, at least in the field of seizure of assets, for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.	4.926713391046712
Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice.	2.996977447818306
This is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery, a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament, led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives.	3.433696248186178
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it?	3.2842645130145556
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	3.8724406042415
) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll ' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time.	3.9608291382062455
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak ' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude, even physical absence, of the strong man of Damascus, President Assad, at the negotiations in the United States.	3.2304284326648687
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.	3.508228053036653
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	3.2700785112630952
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.	3.4304639223557514
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation ' of the European Union.	3.5927557247587747
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	3.84783674763646
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.	4.426870133956971
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	3.2148012696948
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries ' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	4.069434316554819
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.	3.9086603160777704
Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.	4.752334090582558
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU ' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group.	3.7618603020677757
So what should we do?	3.184989791338308
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	5.142362316828299
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate.	4.7708087207237835
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned.	3.127497530603266
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	3.6601204069992144
The consequences do not inspire hope.	4.9285374581412995
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.	3.306157186531414
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	3.6682857170832865
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence.	5.367443173235137
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	5.430257583776361
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.	4.823599336271812
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	3.8757946368904386
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	3.1005663407699777
However, I should like to stress INTERREG ' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	3.8403284458900444
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.	3.0887615238549433
In specific terms, we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations, at which this will be a central issue.	5.959592494919207
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries.	3.40038230168466
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	3.7750015520345688
Do we have a special problem in this regard?	4.86512995220283
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc?	2.949240298226452
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.	4.918917273074833
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	3.7049529419592435
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age.	3.0224539617850508
However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti ' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital.	5.0034167388881166
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.	6.223695588895185
I also believe that Parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission ' s proposal.	4.824107153175131
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	4.336022346625423
Take Sudan.	3.169966210090082
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey 's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	2.937370897346125
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.	3.8426865872138722
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings.	4.012847560992752
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.4860394600720443
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	3.6131124066558518
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider 's and the Freedom Party 's words, but also of their deeds?	4.383808869191352
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.	3.55530415995552
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit.	3.498690887357565
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.	3.558955502849986
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.	2.8023641065802782
I beg to move acceptance of this report.	4.020433529324627
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.	4.568282685604452
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.	5.573429074085019
Mr President, I would like to offer a few explanations.	3.4265693804150317
The European Union must take the initiative and must also, as demanded in the motion, propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.	4.382696934066642
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.	2.8924007577724264
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.	3.4339389660143502
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.	4.0920040339317705
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	3.69781293762804
Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why.	3.4895322789460974
They can also be consulted on the Commission 's Internet website.	5.96120311697145
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this.	4.557717235663297
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	4.381944483475004
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	3.6549319876440873
Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions.	4.577414989130593
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.	3.5811019085789257
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	3.9369918879353554
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	3.4575261669152244
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten ' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	3.42201041067651
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure.	4.969456403972511
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.	4.1075661706952395
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	3.9543582904014705
We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies.	3.6764983516903444
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.	3.0970800324015446
Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation.	3.4584418309301754
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.	4.159263619176364
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	3.5716025027659954
This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment.	3.073916819146573
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.	3.6745579072290293
Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.	3.6155295444170075
Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another.	4.1885839041265145
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text.	3.456828113576761
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union ' s per capita GDP level.	5.26050830052633
I shall, however, mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers.	3.322915868686273
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	3.733381241506157
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies.	4.133889775341524
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)	1.9495261182018413
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	3.160856180757735
Do forgive me.	3.714296053716782
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	2.9762723311079435
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.	3.7304868052565543
Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements.	4.919848005094679
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment.	5.617484385182625
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner.	4.299094714556425
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	4.109555979512767
I propose that we start the debate immediately.	3.8822682196482985
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe.	4.223483735683014
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	3.7893631422966347
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse.	3.828053499185371
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.	4.459234257198092
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.	2.9537294640610128
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	3.349873588770221
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.	3.6805572838217877
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	3.872305922929949
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish.	4.789948536017828
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993.	3.2327727528364374
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	4.361811383341036
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.	4.050086565822589
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA ' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.	2.847530441087604
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.	3.8634304767548358
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	4.683051643755936
They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood.	3.0814200853233578
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	3.2434307731775323
No, it does not!	3.230714728303423
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	2.7634545088614515
The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences.	4.626510908557615
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	4.475470350970032
. Mr President, I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs -some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lomé Agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.	3.3031115164640426
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation.	5.050421917291456
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	4.2087497885165455
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines.	4.761301776395631
Furthermore, I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention, and the fact that, following extremely complex and difficult negotiations, we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit.	3.82806933454554
This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.6849332056119266
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	4.805090927567116
First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided.	3.4504172968184506
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future.	3.8948937016032095
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	4.1044954198897265
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	3.6248999590241757
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.	4.3770131935283105
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group.	4.575603803638735
We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	3.6374270275702894
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	4.136341928957478
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets.	6.053022756329005
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	3.970805234202233
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.	3.5118657933748314
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	4.389283393920452
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government.	3.994701739084938
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry.	3.432535192659074
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.	4.285594165210327
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about.	6.564996327503522
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question.	3.8872228892299576
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.	3.6677671611698472
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	5.404568259392172
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	3.0951399146617624
We are not going to enter into a debate now.	5.041498003468066
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	1.8683735141081432
The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself.	4.262328429284408
In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction.	4.270508791238736
Both documents, that is the Commission 's document and the Ombudsman 's draft, cover largely the same ground.	4.45344338725654
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.	3.7196538290827967
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	5.439023612281147
The market is a law unto itself.	4.246518370573664
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine.	3.944198511496563
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	3.7135511406929687
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2).	4.284750340592029
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.5033529389158162
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider ' s.	3.644319288806402
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee.	3.3736587072884854
Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.	3.362997956004195
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.	3.5401636062303363
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.	5.748098780119456
May I say something about costs.	2.7716760513596475
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.	3.447892206842463
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	3.408608870022424
Lastly, in today ' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.	3.9296992928123347
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration.	6.601098467776482
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People ' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	3.6453503042429536
Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings.	2.497735915369556
This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group.	5.073016139611127
However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.	3.8113751316166473
Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff.	4.387025045026159
We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds.	5.492282398490858
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	4.038999644036153
Think of last year ' s deadly criticism of the Commission ' s lack of propriety, ethics and accountability.	3.112224707623097
'Long-winded ' .	1.5852248468772185
Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.	4.096994337403833
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential.	2.695931698032941
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations, will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.	4.257191348092992
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another.	5.575951555379347
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	4.219874642609545
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement.	4.533892088948284
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?	3.5347775318165784
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.	4.019141544172401
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account.	3.246346301483206
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again ' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	3.726820428194188
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	4.159746273084094
You still have not finished that agenda.	4.132434133123557
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.	2.855674306963137
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot.	4.429716688071987
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.	4.181317465773528
A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases.	3.240424367669533
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met.	4.64057989967452
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality ', 'gender ' and 'women ' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe '.	2.404725312912877
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government.	4.405520826402673
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	4.072160163212143
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.	4.253210444697834
What are the conditions for this recognition?	4.08254825136851
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?	3.053009591451138
It is nothing less than legal torture.	3.5617902052762758
This must be regulated during the IGC.	4.231083059763887
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations.	4.345067640329252
It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals.	3.5099185596593676
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	4.934032269214607
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests.	5.175848750715962
The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one.	4.707263858908803
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.	4.282680781905654
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.	4.235340365212313
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	3.7384633676248646
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.	4.521463583191769
(The Minutes were adopted)	2.5931578719671147
The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union.	3.47578277943195
Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this.	3.2916350255064293
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.	3.5970250839824414
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights.	3.4081489846486694
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.	3.6557774721265117
Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, "Cocoon", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again.	3.267406672755183
Does the Commission support the Council?	2.347155397715175
As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend.	3.4154566095187615
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	4.230433811565293
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	2.9126055192302958
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work.	3.9603154113940535
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified.	4.910853382428073
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement.	2.732259191244675
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe.	4.226263702356197
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.	4.618708098374848
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro.	3.9570448997486602
In this first speech, I would like to share with Parliament the Commission ' s view of the most important events in 1999.	5.510003101333046
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.	4.129660015021853
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	4.51887313822028
The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down.	4.642487724407298
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve.	5.105124838240501
I can partly accept Amendment No 11.	4.814395134102054
And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things.	3.120640565186542
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria ' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.	3.2877424191908573
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.	6.082326701961853
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.	4.261566013086609
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.	2.8817344334643353
The plant is not yet there.	6.767829842199531
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.	3.966687068631617
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	4.1463425670451555
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.	3.9495150121555196
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention.	3.7281369237315833
Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure.	3.1926756429570644
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	4.1916163958031785
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.	5.634867891488002
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	4.462812561267968
However, we do not have to resort to extreme solutions, as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report.	4.0630684651088735
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.	4.949372907237823
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?	4.817815056069036
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor.	4.866317488275821
Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation.	3.3936715478051944
It is true that Mozambique ' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them.	3.717606847659616
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome.	3.26774449472724
First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector ' under ESA 95.	3.21458705834095
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests.	2.7037684783273477
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?	3.9335531532132997
The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties.	4.68065617744032
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	3.4257706849023597
We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead.	4.232205730124824
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.	2.9688521038130675
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	3.350170117453407
By rejecting the rapporteur ' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.	2.9903452647796285
Mr President, the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union.	3.3649061978238803
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	4.005473253424647
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	3.853888484815158
So far, as you know, this has proved unsuccessful, and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary.	4.667166382798022
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	4.236921811100304
The vote will be taken later this evening.	3.9867256867401006
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.	3.680194044415453
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling, reuse and incineration, as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions.	3.6086704486294257
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	3.0734083047951644
Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.	3.6755208573552602
I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States.	4.445564665882442
A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe ' s structural policies.	4.199391129671129
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.	4.080298339213349
In its communication "Women and Science" , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe.	3.9722014682525817
However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework.	4.659243219032854
If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future.	3.6243467412132717
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?	2.8714899394344973
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	4.272805230045228
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission ' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today.	4.098301562104474
The overriding features of today ' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.	3.7297195975379376
I. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (5713/1999 - C5-0020/1999 - 1999/0803(CNS)	2.1709912937442004
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.	3.0975196246680903
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.	2.9497755564273866
First: we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways.	2.928957558356382
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.	4.028844597119245
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	4.259446542703088
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.	4.074540695886843
I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.	3.38841960159144
In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made.	3.7593814060763675
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.	3.7964698389825084
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.	4.004036066108568
We must put an end to this.	3.4632829266998
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States ' national accounting.	4.9102922376164235
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU ' s water legislation.	3.766263525913944
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio ' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	3.821555415113216
This is not policy; it is life ' s simple logic.	3.6045432294218327
It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States.	3.6075523711459967
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	3.804842727079815
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	2.850697453437062
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission ' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made.	3.6188592607399133
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it ' s three times for a Welshman ' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	3.464924854710367
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement	3.9975864540428727
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship.	3.8144328808876393
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future.	4.624794624623945
As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy.	3.320933267994841
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	3.273593613741754
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.	2.1945845978460525
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.	4.06249205637719
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.9499896556025176
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	3.721044101334005
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	3.3872243467511494
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.	4.857556138905836
Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes.	3.691836838765249
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	3.3874443198154607
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	3.219167950019346
We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright.	4.1074484412477075
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points.	3.6264453480501446
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market.	4.782660548357082
Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member ' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive.	3.2788626708774093
Nor is it a mere luxury.	2.8080889567018392
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard?	4.068759146894339
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	4.031917889235399
It must form the basis for our partners ' political will.	4.379638145286133
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	3.70508093993074
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.	4.407809229466212
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	3.9684822636734127
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	4.040212893351625
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	3.22312926204067
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	5.096258289108714
The Left ' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision ' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere.	4.0834677399035435
Conditions are ripe.	1.9921569291966088
Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria.	4.266772205245752
Mr Alavanos, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised.	4.347691676705813
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	3.7533744105819165
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	5.9499612302328755
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.	3.2526264813273613
In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests.	4.816069914566699
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	5.819334890138293
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.	3.6604976657685313
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate.	4.346487189005911
To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors: seek better focus, better coordination and concentrated activities.	4.144388481709564
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?	4.557998971173558
Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero.	3.697720778122663
I consider this to be very encouraging news.	5.0560668792582435
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.	4.049281164596677
The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission ' s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence.	3.8538667379829454
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations.	3.2263249981577555
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications.	4.863194273407038
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.	4.385855689181165
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.	2.9896218500251286
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	3.5831848092359633
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).	1.938182284654249
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds.	5.000317431834122
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage.	3.199177041807154
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.	4.637672241029139
Mr President, Mr Katiforis ' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice.	3.779866745061584
It is a retrograde step.	4.598892526310843
This is in place too.	5.600056267618292
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS)	2.1092172107269755
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly ' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria.	4.245724673218822
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .	3.9823322729388764
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	3.2193166765879955
It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.	4.621560863811759
That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas.	3.535727903812021
Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way.	3.539554814528609
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	4.536355293870628
I will mention two point that may create tension.	4.183085705301483
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole.	4.585949869150068
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	4.356568461293473
Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague 's Bavarian beer?	2.82111446172387
It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations.	4.062056663872333
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	4.160208100224528
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities.	3.0383659308950133
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people.	2.823329973106153
Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union.	4.2216717591864965
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	4.081586544717048
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.	3.399934251642191
Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain.	3.0324047827108296
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state, government and party delirium as regards the European Union ' s funding.	4.435227867944133
This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104.	3.0222877410495297
When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence.	3.8117582003172066
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	3.9987664043174984
Ideally the European Parliament ' s representatives should be able to support Cuba ' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	3.4996412184243764
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	4.580740930860439
Thirdly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive.	4.580606385327889
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	3.79734680587707
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	4.251085230413722
For us, the Group of the European People ' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years.	4.750508673582766
Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN ' s Resolution 1244.	3.5000022197995717
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	4.847241845221664
How decisions are made is all-important.	4.469081648995351
The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union.	6.604729602526408
I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.	4.768430937575018
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment.	5.256673831495297
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring.	4.18370110047901
In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed.	3.5684543594090927
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.	6.787512793718086
It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.	3.348702332745623
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission.	3.0187443411377934
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back.	2.627073181648955
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	3.5650399106456523
II. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses (COM(1998) 451 - C4-0465/1998 - 1998/0242(COD)	2.607338506750153
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?	4.293253125410904
They are still in training, as it were.	3.9005494773958684
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	3.067493488538134
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights ' section.	3.4907996435013464
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation?	3.0009889046463702
Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe.	2.4277729085380413
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	3.4438961311131435
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe.	3.6497980512196735
Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.	2.7424408324099927
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	5.087258818708125
I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving.	3.6163240251397086
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	4.238284999045233
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	3.180520365753666
All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO ' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor.	3.253229942082952
The foul monster has been reawakened!	5.558505307484319
The message contained in the joint text is still valid.	6.8397055030482194
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion.	4.652370587383296
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.	3.988284444334428
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world ' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	3.4666048592969267
And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.	3.74743055819468
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly.	4.9954579066167355
The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions.	4.107522362037887
Mr President, I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.	3.690077529443704
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	4.018136396612575
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.	4.278908940294947
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.	4.191725041049435
In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.	3.657529473616458
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.	3.8585691595116964
This requires internal stability.	5.027284329388363
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission ' s and the Council ' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?	6.262468396676845
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.	4.3134330254713165
(FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	3.2241653981184086
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	4.646538586858257
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.	4.132248492938198
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success.	3.973928624614562
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	4.005171688105987
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.	4.63181233129572
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.	3.324061635532009
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed.	5.130597252619378
On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999.	3.5994847112035258
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.5033529389158162
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm.	4.059591523556481
In creating a citizens ' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.	3.8263035052174206
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.	4.346672007272183
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.	5.22224153614353
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows?	3.2460354913042986
As far as we, the Council presidency, are concerned, we will continue to follow these developments very closely, and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter.	3.6240265367590108
However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence.	5.573224512976858
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.	4.193952656885805
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.	2.9560741327813918
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	4.0185967377806655
It regards tourism for senior citizens.	4.832472947355794
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation.	4.027191324286004
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms.	5.474496568204268
Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition.	3.4285414103784713
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	4.6206279813601085
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel ' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives.	4.674441655926294
Goebbels (PSE).	1.938182284654249
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	4.277692335195054
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.	5.2336213114442005
That is my first question.	4.278499348422316
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors.	3.6243289572064645
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	5.109244155178623
It is clear that this model ' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays ' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences.	3.3749243383753162
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA.	3.3382314934388924
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	4.195843758753104
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected.	3.0648453314108166
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	5.234117320232071
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents ' era and their parents ' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live.	3.608209577319815
The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available.	4.845552596526102
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	3.6825692382341293
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.	3.5514351171484657
This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional.	4.061821398446553
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal.	3.3633048989410774
Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa.	4.1635788573788055
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative.	3.7191985748033773
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.	3.9980580106853925
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	3.664982282991691
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	4.195938307885124
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	4.858428946757528
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.	7.572109533414949
I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing.	5.179810506643361
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility.	6.488726283826765
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations.	3.7609650700898873
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.	4.011704468529995
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far.	2.859700592689492
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	5.8108870736492175
The first concerns this Parliament.	4.049884345987689
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger.	5.60691507839236
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	2.796368367055374
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.	3.319914692332964
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	2.398087982879144
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence.	3.7500050178137063
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring.	2.949570382623669
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	3.078010284202325
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	3.4533294952835725
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report.	4.320283361721385
Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report.	4.723482421764318
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	3.7239958711799117
As was emphasised at Tampere, and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies, which strengthen the links between the Union ' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union ' s position on the world stage.	4.659761838736941
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers ' liability.	3.7506011383241136
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading.	4.377019784179551
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	3.8822494939659733
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.	4.392910520761909
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	3.093272706607027
From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider.	3.1825489470875734
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	3.2569668182977844
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.	4.504768900321593
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.	3.1857054841931975
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations.	2.5730371666666985
. Let me associate myself, not least as a former Environment Minister, completely and without any reservation whatsoever, with the expressions of concern by honourable Members.	3.097257680417866
Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking.	3.623653336597767
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.	4.009879822456578
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	4.304216595844779
I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition.	3.816992278511954
As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health.	4.3425526535336365
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	4.5990116912992525
The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe.	3.640307369898119
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.	2.940118717710866
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions.	4.221485178898978
On paper!	6.113306519025124
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.	4.235061269497869
In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.	3.2787833269006335
And because of the programme ' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	3.9199235422393723
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	4.153842972928208
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	2.549555884927494
This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen.	3.5505643230938726
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government.	3.3248638986086667
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.	4.358262317206874
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.	4.302920756944957
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.	3.6039019766403384
Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.	4.131499201872803
So, for example, the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	4.180672413200587
Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol.	3.33297293674759
The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations.	3.793126088110621
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims ' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.	3.6469389089962463
This kind of situation should not be allowed.	4.345346816126982
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security.	4.417735417287445
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.	3.1242438134416397
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank.	2.3226204563893487
It has become eminently political.	4.288347689288068
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights.	3.313584526237401
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	3.0081057296920286
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.	3.0488897407383297
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream.	3.2539826278897723
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.	2.856107700786752
This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.	3.903866063281903
As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions.	3.9026153730841417
This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries.	3.7585805707367284
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.	4.532902048552936
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks.	4.450729611398984
By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society.	3.4209315957789412
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue.	5.0848454317659915
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.	3.455404321231611
I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe.	4.112483879433864
This is a crucial goal.	5.039152503833358
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals.	4.6524246490913574
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	3.7484630143934488
It is about keeping communities together.	3.936077175060379
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.	4.227191880451608
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.	5.14605957870358
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code.	3.354718595831957
Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union.	4.066737062725664
It raises expectations, but it can also lead to disappointment.	4.974695348895623
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved.	3.7987080963972546
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.	4.117865323780183
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion.	3.814450679046133
To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79.	4.473904887346744
At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid.	2.979112582450452
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable.	5.439393517025502
According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds.	3.487444414695467
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	4.991826856759182
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.	3.5476538894402156
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.	4.863319261887593
It worked for us.	5.22302932298994
From now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition.	3.9097841705012017
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands.	4.1698143277764785
I recommend the report to the House.	5.684728235784204
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	3.2013577664706174
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	4.725499928046902
It is a 'Trojan horse ' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War.	3.087870636058183
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.9953875855239103
In 1998, we had 55 murders.	4.667412718570042
The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level.	4.432094702596089
Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity, this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid: one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources.	4.545986496109199
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	3.6211838186644947
Having set it up, I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust.	3.6922681657834366
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies ' turnover.	2.618597279534374
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions.	4.450184785437556
He is a driven man, a competent man.	2.653965380832976
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	3.6047104257770988
That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.	3.6055654478144286
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	2.04409523449518
This is where we want to go.	5.62837606650952
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	3.628697761676842
Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.	3.129034773871794
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.	4.373049519576509
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.	4.403948876561306
We already have an infrastructure.	4.574506484526706
Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems.	2.7815312625878836
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it.	3.4966586043922883
I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted.	4.418519266314724
Once again, an indigenous people ' s right of existence is being threatened.	2.784154684325038
We are now four months down the line.	3.4024198911281056
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement.	4.128959225218556
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.	3.861085919140652
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	3.085744558440871
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards.	3.482416780363249
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature.	3.64672288008636
Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled.	2.4236573232799263
On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society.	3.6473734738676478
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	3.396210567498952
. (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer.	3.3357994150771386
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	4.276492563329232
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds.	4.087610546047417
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term.	4.096074332754534
I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks.	4.131168922971881
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.	3.646766065343644
Intergovernmental Conference	2.900459118214502
It is never easy working on comitology.	3.9435197917824336
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament.	3.612651922194161
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	3.6071394207109657
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment.	4.851565003430994
According to UNIFIL, there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw, which is something we welcome.	3.3755404402808495
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	3.71729831958923
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done.	3.798523749863518
They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species.	2.8669469899008244
As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State.	4.3178562697825145
I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening.	3.8313457779936413
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air.	3.5634251312032914
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service.	2.9687866740495963
The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result.	5.455045170368096
Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union.	4.201151421194247
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament 's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union 's food safety regime.	4.484471116240576
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):	2.955565300346704
Parliament cannot change these details.	3.739447500640264
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.	4.273460692036854
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.	3.8152615752775216
It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.	4.5000096286781135
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	4.4606561666492395
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.	4.542194680046339
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	3.776267801664399
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session.	4.523055102872642
In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended.	4.275310434897213
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	3.4839292842097405
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	3.080790759557412
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.	4.219545876555156
It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least.	4.15606664593705
Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.	4.98754902813502
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	3.8594301671698794
If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme.	4.661854439126537
Today ' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.	3.2107164255418783
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	3.691244531753162
On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.	4.1679663145706956
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	4.372796842550835
Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector.	3.1692293394811517
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually.	3.328883608227595
However, on this occasion, the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord.	4.698962644706309
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d 'intention.	3.516128476064169
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	3.721743322464375
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.	4.350089621582132
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.	4.028322524563637
The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works.	4.348631854391344
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	3.6964553999845986
The fabric of Turkey ' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.	4.94488035367992
As the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, remarked in a dramatic appeal, each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans.	3.3667509485461906
Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included.	3.8872980522121643
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	3.565831086480296
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this.	3.609996554887136
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.	5.153531478280658
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	4.02779695768898
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.	3.031408300515045
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution.	3.719875531152445
Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola?	4.026012219546749
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	2.647531341194896
Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.	4.383051110770116
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	2.8515533833638096
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance.	5.312429037255782
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	3.548943735929245
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still.	3.3650978701784973
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes.	4.26177270266358
Today, in many Member States, that is not possible.	4.471026503714108
We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction, giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth.	3.6334037193424096
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	3.165937224153809
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
In this respect, we support Libya ' s participation, provided that it recognises human rights, renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process.	2.783354982448175
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line.	4.190987463690789
On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions.	4.702932817771865
Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations.	3.516778854672845
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	2.867120115904247
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	3.5415994883249216
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined.	3.5653984523657
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.	4.294858169609982
It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots.	4.3319789070599155
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements.	3.9989729527546243
I cannot see a reason, therefore, why a further extension for this measure should be proposed.	3.5965263050309937
Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery.	3.236133436065968
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.	3.2296481451375874
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this.	6.144294433399584
Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation.	4.609540981726794
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years.	4.262803412348495
For these are prerequisite to any development.	3.695288187413286
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes.	3.6680322253338007
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	4.2901439166923305
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	4.393152835614405
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	3.3219318065080676
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	4.876698819509415
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	3.042733274389203
But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided.	4.545589289752057
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC. This is in the special interest of northern European regions.	3.874228160421353
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.	3.565654273739538
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that.	3.5930499686432062
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	4.46849578051046
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship ' s sides mechanically.	4.333115602993583
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission ' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	3.532676316580369
Even more serious is the government ' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal.	3.619518194868358
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union!	4.73802046416991
The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance.	5.152155370596105
There is no room for amendments.	3.2183781622426086
Finally, we consider that tourism can, in addition to being a growth factor, be a factor for democracy, and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear, conscious commitment.	5.137523509133711
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large.	4.316516606035835
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level.	3.024327650521497
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	4.07302839649487
The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women ' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women.	4.519350199663168
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens ' tax money?	4.386574492720663
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	3.9776801611191446
Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater.	3.7127068854865994
Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you.	3.229126304052179
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.	3.7260979411216373
Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail.	3.368728171566372
Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us.	2.836026312745261
I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution.	5.778803978375586
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past.	4.119568770144575
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	4.177193873113352
The Council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited.	4.87723947122606
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission ' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .	4.824004047025117
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering.	5.535872980885897
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	3.7644923940568233
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets.	3.0155207890569984
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	5.114765502198454
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	5.305584643337265
Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment.	3.904695558758395
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement.	5.354599496919342
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	4.865442108010523
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.	4.7440786549083525
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	6.0791477343190925
We shall address this problem and check all the translations.	4.349957725068058
However, the financial controllers must work independently.	4.275122034275884
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised.	3.951585516152127
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.	3.3360843677159986
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.	4.348155203171653
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	3.5889153720972646
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life ' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	3.827173233474493
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.	4.6643172517985105
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme, the presidency believes that it is worthwhile, bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty, to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.	5.062234864091476
In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.	3.1569810091313304
. (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market.	4.27546318399412
You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world ' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990.	3.131573529176827
The Austrian People ' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.	3.509515033726883
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission 's main vocation.	4.502345915990895
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	4.968669147472457
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	4.010886299541933
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	3.4657769870170165
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.	3.513118942223351
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.	3.746440383934741
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage.	4.375808598506196
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.	3.34923169906638
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.	3.9972961059094296
The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.	4.144378053505489
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	3.1260620006168764
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	3.916760551660247
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation.	3.401116599351586
The smell is absolutely disgusting!	6.228779130547515
The Commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	3.581200522515201
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.	3.482868157729105
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	4.935827904929601
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable.	1.9007181618512672
We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved.	3.8914065465161567
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements, as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone!	5.219676045043621
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.	4.643823461618132
There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part.	4.120928781549107
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.	3.53353009065781
I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.	3.612259755132081
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	4.203836154353083
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	3.9466196027395424
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.	4.129729143712854
No.	2.6655180066171553
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	4.249166626303925
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	3.18436471676685
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.	3.4198961514023734
We have seen vote after vote lost.	3.8385493596468936
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children.	2.6497468143867455
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements . declared universally applicable ' (cf. Article 3(1) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	2.968545767503684
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	3.8935897815597236
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery.	3.8461217980615947
Court of First Instance	2.8034482344515763
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	4.04373479827342
Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.	3.229123594375576
We all very much share this opinion.	5.21006036087444
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter.	5.017251922441377
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse.	3.4622856831924174
(Applause from the PSE Group)	1.1675143331948095
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	4.623504062453257
During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures.	3.0687092590075746
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.	3.1999404687050856
I congratulate him on his excellent report.	3.8897091490861695
We all have, as it were, our histories to live with, but it is important that business has legal certainty.	3.6192457019403714
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.	4.234973116267529
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission ' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers ' amendments to this point.	4.0507264886099374
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection.	4.532510717778769
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes.	4.701158151224452
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	3.5079919106621436
As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase.	5.197308602607271
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.	4.051761625910762
But we should not lower our standards too much either.	3.5674654574767213
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	4.7266432628464115
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	3.8329958005179483
Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.	4.339751832649845
Coherence of EU policies with development	2.2576164819561213
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view.	5.477179092134758
With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.	4.280315611876732
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission ' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?	4.961688988605346
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug ' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	3.6024191662464946
The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika.	2.774117138034397
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.	5.177835886796732
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.	2.9974028418269265
It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives.	3.1034233990670286
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	3.7387370809889386
A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences.	4.131318911995846
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative.	3.285901395676054
That is all to the good.	4.0889296485037665
In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage.	4.5122718912442625
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.	3.3702646945007873
Community policy in the field of water	2.8236235216009846
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	3.8864330821889483
What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast?	4.134883327264759
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.	4.120559866718549
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	3.2031756338427444
Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole.	4.2306528042510605
Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees, corruption, human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lomé Convention from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region.	3.5543478092045317
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool ' s bargain for French taxpayers.	3.519344875503354
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	3.6746189276417556
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	4.547015549501905
Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact.	4.04208651599049
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	4.009899847085159
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan ' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	4.379826918300766
In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements.	4.052484060581608
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	3.335871593516716
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.	3.000256827056534
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on her very serious work.	3.46870795357531
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.	4.657757297807523
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	4.536090148361311
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	4.0913884088849874
Are there any comments?	1.2692975256400874
There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society.	2.9910202141795854
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either.	3.670291909977477
In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance.	4.10240117418463
However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved.	3.8253399808937667
Why is it so important in that sector?	3.8042593830898106
This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds.	3.2560403944252405
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.	4.104157085839623
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice.	3.7147228974985635
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.	3.494125423384103
.	1.3940351656188106
The third area of incoherence is human rights.	3.8829581221536826
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.	5.0919893595117
It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures.	3.338899525083546
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union.	4.057048486014211
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management.	4.5872932371719966
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.	4.406780545428678
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.	3.1743636703508913
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999.	3.802010562006108
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.	3.944032367537247
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed.	1.8775223687129037
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now.	3.1007926730536512
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	4.744786926305883
Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures.	3.104701283171927
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.	5.387986399056074
On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year ' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000.	3.4740400049251283
More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised.	4.69229312681308
I have taken note of your comment, Mr Speroni.	3.7309998835917835
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube ' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	4.218237494654724
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.	2.9364012167370817
These are what are missing.	4.027487767707231
What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests?	4.972860264211758
Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe.	2.941933665077555
A paper this short is a farce.	3.7837974076793968
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information.	5.125496251620098
Over 95% of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world.	3.0867698959440744
Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species.	3.581059455282343
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	3.0224356804995716
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	4.172064567977068
I think that Mrs Lienemann ' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council.	4.232302087752454
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	4.346288055734678
Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration" . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration" .	3.064506665827163
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.	3.9724158953035804
Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects.	3.372177199237426
Mr President, the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East.	3.6116979581455273
As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	3.866265354874426
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.	2.9747956113460443
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	2.8175653991502676
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars.	4.226876167912874
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	4.442955233274188
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	3.3701849611677983
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16.	3.6975905416961328
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	4.900658910862012
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community ' s regional policy.	5.870459876734876
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda.	3.7766342819239362
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	3.213668495705472
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.	3.868353373424443
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.	3.394453237859305
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.	4.005646333536365
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	4.233328846245926
Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs.	4.2725997355559695
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	4.633171010608855
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	2.078302317073799
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	3.952592965782793
However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive ' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment.	5.171189924247105
I should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism, the tourism exported from the Member States of the European Union. I am referring to sex tourism.	3.8238840296410443
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.	4.191395172656435
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia ' s stability.	3.397135486752489
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	4.362906406351993
Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month.	3.7847162013562787
It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips.	3.2811240346482387
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists.	4.19958089332405
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present.	3.7721395749651134
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	4.465112024638894
If Mr Katiforis ' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched.	3.9537538546247126
Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi ' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for.	4.053193353706388
Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000)	2.7217157233384426
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	4.530465351744286
weighting of votes in the Council	2.842230418328346
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	3.336377631367385
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted.	3.7829545603514494
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):	2.5649229896829064
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	4.579173494705569
That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility.	3.8706895654053572
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.	4.149541195267424
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	6.999190154776492
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.	3.207168940422399
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection.	3.613936793650736
After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.	3.527441410448739
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	3.710751670538167
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today, with this debate and this motion, this question is now on the agenda of European construction.	4.605347092882381
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report.	5.299213486371883
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women ' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built.	4.327176132070491
In Finland surface waters are very clean.	4.860941234951323
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.	3.926870552055385
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	4.154995790891219
This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission ' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies.	5.2494083572981225
I would ask you to use the full name of our Group.	4.118021646694013
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.	3.106487684178509
Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring.	3.7429078252000454
I have a number of ideas which should be put across.	7.246320800387329
For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission.	3.2545724961292235
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal, and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week.	4.435022513634369
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	3.924980488793833
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	3.9584895807049176
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension.	3.98366272304537
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	4.016086466731677
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.	2.790057612290784
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.	3.3451823657057735
I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation.	5.497706250784872
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	2.8860184591184694
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	4.344165564622583
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention.	5.146282044649154
Water and air surround us everywhere.	2.688411123899403
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret.	4.444192234386561
I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect.	5.441107385079569
I expect that Parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	4.578192637841733
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	4.69847979378308
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement.	5.203692453866531
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	3.676525978282766
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	3.40519426320496
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.	4.800609950870909
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.	4.3469224379182965
At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system.	2.9505153004154394
That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action.	3.809585561429181
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.	4.973273067284794
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function.	5.3923656699841285
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee ' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks.	4.785942031330341
Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine.	3.9126903488905764
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present.	4.1034566410740245
Mr President, in accordance with Article 69 (2), I call for referral back to committee.	3.2014154460595314
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	4.109217366765338
I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.	4.416174569625963
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	5.560721556286514
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	3.7622364596616134
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	3.5761874950264554
I look forward to the next round.	4.705570269181241
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.	3.5513205424489254
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens.	5.176383282943667
I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now.	4.515136957998695
Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria	4.118609627766425
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	3.686349113770147
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.	4.5531525667014145
The post office is democracy.	5.18225838185569
So what was done at Amsterdam?	3.952813623208227
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.	2.4430400226016804
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	3.865268044803836
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties.	4.2806964275503745
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	4.785523853197889
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication.	4.629093572685544
I understand this.	6.788117986567228
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	3.4261376888797215
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission.	3.941346597159118
Welcome	1.0963497644087596
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	4.089650783409343
The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support.	3.937196054996982
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	3.5553110725196366
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.	4.141458750087787
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	4.104576303881127
The UN has a peace plan.	5.309380335199816
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission ' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	3.460916758038665
Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.	2.2453013825037678
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.	4.897076491018673
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.	3.2772133100077108
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	4.594787929970129
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.	4.056691619440827
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.	6.121534115894679
Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice?	3.6458101357342496
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.	3.010354717938535
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends.	4.533237499846368
Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.	3.287899737991961
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa.	7.25294831284047
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work.	5.758173360046693
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	4.208446945396165
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	5.148444439233256
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect.	2.610292326727453
Such policy should comprise various components.	3.229705088950696
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.	3.993701888597878
No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union.	2.8642833676831705
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	5.074588141271589
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously.	4.241171216132409
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.	4.8865437414163635
What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market.	3.558123043117361
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF.	3.9974299863321625
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!	3.8975559436761733
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	4.254221104053357
Clearly, the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, southern regions for example, is very different, and should be studied carefully.	3.2962473620681956
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.	4.750642956982256
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.	3.8564034878489917
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union.	4.059304689488703
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again.	4.719165439090495
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	3.8644032189029436
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	3.346550558819371
This too is a particular desire of my group.	3.845513714059327
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.	3.8079819497859995
The postal service is also the social service.	4.049570570266551
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.	3.9868388509274872
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	3.7501745112766005
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons.	3.5393065514663284
While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion.	4.171210592699203
Delays in the CEN ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.	4.0311835847242135
But we need that reform process.	3.5502016234189706
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	5.184632211026899
Amendments Nos 39, 40, 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives.	2.2524745345030666
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	4.140487822290324
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people.	5.062643298407474
For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa.	3.4899416414334596
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world ' s most contaminated areas.	3.090990274792724
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	3.6907440644269744
However, we must stick to the facts.	3.518926818431275
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.	4.175960331562762
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	4.033580858428568
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month.	3.6381832167270773

May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference.	4.148813768595322
LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States.	3.345425150765686
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks?	3.828690651419111
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	4.298762522178886
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission.	3.3056821556174083
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	3.3609703969466866
This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond.	3.1947902625370936
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.	4.981533977931585
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.	4.746407002523202
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.	5.5240098319377955
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter.	4.043711791871449
The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.	4.020058518202195
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven.	4.823371630468395
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	3.376865260514154
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.	4.011563078461669
Not necessary!	4.326069055693267
The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.	4.403331828417475
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government.	3.1356005882108384
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education.	3.8219066285805097
As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	3.4510233197603335
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	3.979488631216078
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers.	4.706887495641312
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	4.782232751895519
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on.	4.333633566291406
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.	3.8698728330964616
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	3.3022841108307435
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure	2.018070537503435
Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products.	3.7991837314270978
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	3.561728908917056
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development.	3.453244611579086
Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission.	3.9947067690607083
In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission.	3.5875468048202777
Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers ' health.	3.5091909454460426
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	4.510720861032741
I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament.	3.184654232140804
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	4.974110007563668
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	5.047560897400637
This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs ' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.	4.206472067012666
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation.	3.891044584238321
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	4.565805467588381
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority 's establishment.	4.2884845298231165
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.	2.9674251760893977
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.	2.409460347064346
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	1.554147740218332
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources.	4.043504206546969
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.8143819275036557
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.	3.7687930200519353
There is, therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union, a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself.	5.311285742556905
That time is now past.	5.1907672741589845
It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way.	4.535606448597402
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	5.250677290481201
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year.	3.549247352634475
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.	3.604465086534047
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons.	3.572402905082541
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	4.302188579562952
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.	4.964905263029044
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	3.5859831477756376
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.	3.2950761407494684
But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing.	4.615179913608398
The honourable Member raised the question.	3.984863101315127
We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast.	4.063638122092887
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	6.136847989499067
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals.	4.084097919930586
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	3.972264383064233
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.	4.8373712404997224
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.	5.9424526381035045
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	4.972652118930324
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union.	3.3663913411522057
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.	6.002275166821596
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	4.761473938430589
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance.	4.53508021216217
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3811274786686611
In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.	3.424483631603576
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries.	3.4692150786779115
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	5.29904337782813
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.	3.946844930798992
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	3.417899933294758
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	4.1072661211692205
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	4.984681900479916
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.	3.617949153644557
The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field.	5.572407717873351
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	4.329010265587027
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model.	5.102020270231088
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	3.592695699316089
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur.	3.3650946477553596
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon, which has been accepted, will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists.	3.7706795923973866
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.	4.748017848054367
I think we should take a more positive approach here.	4.603742212437693
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.	4.777719779260493
It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else.	3.2678063540355664
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .	2.637644227585626
Combating certain fish diseases	2.229437822791826
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.	5.269646080224795
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.	3.144577616753909
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	4.604619984313695
Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress.	3.5498703330874584
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States ' election processes?	3.844953919150399
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.	4.958199111469368
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	2.7038987113366697
Thank you for the presentation.	3.261328541712568
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February.	4.077407521870799
Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty.	4.0358757502140055
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.	4.150341393714487
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.	3.061274789013644
That is a more reasonable system.	3.8852085841768402
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	5.44931158200372
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.	3.69277605238355
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.	6.748587340351504
In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.	3.8540190234617486
A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.	3.3983294556024495
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.	4.13822042268186
Although Mr Corrie ' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly ' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union.	3.5491171047132157
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	3.9552375459915683
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	4.691820076939773
Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands.	2.373324197694806
Is there any prospect of membership?	3.2506254160558807
So we come back to the previous problem.	5.060737350063665
As regards fishing proper, passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit.	3.4057696518830927
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.	4.425560550940352
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.	4.629072859721857
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	3.0050337781802128
But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.	3.3506522603424074
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People ' s Democratic Republic of China.	3.497119248708567
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.	4.209488505892558
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.	3.9537065086320817
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	4.680627466787465
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.	3.630994144546403
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	4.725332871863661
Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment.	3.6183474059117993
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.	5.009347551592568
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	3.4656249098958125
The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today ' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement.	4.50525991783916
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.	4.297178250535222
We will raise that, too, in the representations we make.	4.007671653067523
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.	3.7271143690876722
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example.	2.3167524420946837
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	3.4049186317384934
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	4.316871392215115
In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market.	3.479913845791619
It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being.	3.1897690466298343
Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action.	2.9322555909931967
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.	4.45148796857816
Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities.	3.918047174713158
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	4.308246747778603
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	3.9075918596320856
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.	2.969040489172802
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.	4.680742080211104
I have heard many comments on the Commission ' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	4.257653311658322
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	4.351939625603677
Everything that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account.	4.996291155356926
We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats.	4.910729024091885
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	3.779172217022522
You can be satisfied with the progress made.	3.5731073121119015
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	3.796250374532713
Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important.	4.075253650931281
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.	5.78264179674823
Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment.	4.49920685756029
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty?	4.952520059210937
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more référendaire.	4.430283805772376
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	1.9971028287493218
I do hope that this will not be necessary.	5.598810843339323
The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.	5.312395252884761
Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.	4.043539583342218
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.	3.8565239634459045
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.	5.111934880638653
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	4.1520267328419
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.	3.5583131354951187
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	5.264561010617169
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	2.929901269786079
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate.	4.361205962918933
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	4.04013408887933
I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss.	3.200348839819604
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.	4.667958554422648
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	4.77020125119639
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.46341540887631
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	3.602210935203762
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result.	3.4754298154323298
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	2.7283123085368377
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	4.010952522665843
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky ' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	3.414692585275346
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	3.9141788604762406
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.	3.6930501823355812
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	4.916479304152827
Mr President, we should like to request that the last sentence of Amendment No 2 which reads: 'also calls on the Member States to promote tourism for the elderly ' be incorporated into Paragraph 25, which deals specifically with social tourism, after: 'tourism for organised social groups. '.	3.951727439681709
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission.	4.515615058670299
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	4.123293231330269

I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.	4.541051501955398
In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States.	3.801677192120935
As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval.	4.468404634304752
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	3.9051726398117492
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever.	5.772898565524274
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.	4.139736798270273
It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image.	3.599261776344943
The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities.	4.496307260434103
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	2.8678449291159005
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	6.397373396410452
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	3.936415365359268
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	4.504717925050228
This is not the usual state of affairs.	3.4428253587452953
In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.	2.9879911220437467
The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different.	4.036877387331044
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	3.20075938925014
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.	5.409054455143994
In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue.	3.2479738535344413
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.	4.37609088131693
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.	3.3453734030705506
In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is de facto a move in the right direction.	3.6694608466642378
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable?	3.5698546069764494
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	4.107037698722512
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.	5.121926594130409
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	3.2745969099330243
For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.	3.33678039475286
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.	3.8616883825950543
Since the Belgian Government ' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial.	3.6774259838822507
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me.	3.68628010068494
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	4.920212372688063
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.	3.231524527849744
A number of codes have since been introduced.	2.7443367774999903
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.	4.350464672328161
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	4.602026208534611
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.	3.299886257867864
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.	3.7363072907434347
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	4.073153573029875
Thank you for your reply.	1.877309301581086
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?	4.315767556194213
For the Commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence.	3.464572435839936
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	4.446769498936195
It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message.	3.9224899377360436
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	3.4381898950048324
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament ' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	4.543535670722841
Mr President, the Israeli author, Amos Oz, managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently.	2.9097785826105036
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU.	3.740107891211999
This goes to show just how topical this subject is.	3.6250807461778733
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis ' .	4.758817379337139
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	4.525120220506139
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that.	4.487319509767213
In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.	3.85974251241443
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy.	6.310205956795613
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary.	4.198095643261606

One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality.	2.557429093039023
Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.	2.413900594871652
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	2.988604827279389
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner.	4.604926251199107
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	3.9748094909916554
It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser.	3.424014424136967
In this regard we strongly support the High Representative ' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo.	3.9513552582027933
The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors.	3.986068183673595
An essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible.	5.60874625629785
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	3.8648824069709464
In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect.	5.549770926284895
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.	3.9898983288014045
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	3.624896686324281
There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities.	4.082352819617076
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	5.506390995958177
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions.	4.374884747347515
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism.	4.442765067504434
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	3.680347663864958
Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue.	4.968295328948126
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.	3.2467549071128783
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.	3.6886304162515486
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems.	3.492007862275708
Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion.	3.662587913493937
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	3.1455602994125837
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	3.1175980288199603
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.	3.94043152139295
Mr President, we take note that the excuse-making, reticent Presidency, which, in recent months, has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today, has come to an end.	4.237246409025582
The European Commission ' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.	4.84487359016166
Mr Andersson ' s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU.	4.481547489823373

I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow ' s vote.	3.9324089738490735
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.

Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives.	4.790085306462198
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.	4.4078589548488685
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress.	3.850431936236109
It should seal their revival.	4.797927620330174
Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time.	4.243148990024115

Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.	3.967427676868846
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	3.344350909530451

The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	2.51346301926427
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.	3.4966580091664623

That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.	3.9473541124787013
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	2.8411795213613336
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	3.46589087318872
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	4.436939232795257
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	3.9448367709457157

Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	3.252055941193773

I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.	2.749302033092801
Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself.	3.31950025050931
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.	3.379884513590875
Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory.	3.991991099093883

Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.	3.742843598901918
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	2.876010412436837
The EU Presidency ' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.	4.0453133647549535

Resumption of the session	1.0952419733067078
As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money.	3.372895434684718
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.	3.517184712829855
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.	3.999038310997536
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community.	3.2624298663092155
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain.	3.283402313342048
China likes doublespeak.	2.0328545600763746
The proposal cannot therefore be approved.	4.0393090935656
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	4.896712711767367
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	3.4424014224885746
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	3.8492497912951062
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country.	3.1616640522146935
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	5.371909211906583
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission ' s attitude to the issue.	4.102917147422919
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.	4.52676919582517
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	5.3578779845979705
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.	3.20887568146095
I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House.	3.7688392385705507
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!	4.268299124063505
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.	3.5870581623300417
Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions.	3.9810767847231063
The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual.	3.845566853391124
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.	5.351259175032977
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	3.079992259771708
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	4.359504029041214
I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region ' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.	4.899622462472255
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly.	3.6671087437262364
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?	3.7275350696947465
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union ' s financial programmes and instruments.	4.866535949922953
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	4.140974958273301
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice.	3.5068356519421977
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.	4.932093685726722
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper 's proposals on the authority.	5.348169110181487
Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough.	3.1851996311908173
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	3.2240861765020004
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.	3.5407366749784694
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.	5.83796382474972
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival.	5.171701331369656
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens ' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	4.448603969992226
Cambodia	2.114157836315447
But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.	3.7805125189019786
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.	3.003672923530415
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.	4.880678697246934
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.	3.7439612867758427
Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.	3.6668934097292327
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.	7.870189419441359
All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict.	5.1098074576916295
As for the EU ' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children.	4.402166633298473
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.	3.945539952703548
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.	3.6038510691536714
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	3.677290173379076
However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text.	4.886737674326286
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.	3.2029762178045598
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	4.090452980026839
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.	4.378952765193483
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.	4.719927334661538
The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage.	3.860239047414784
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	4.179016554879704
Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational.	3.318273443228173
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.	3.5410553773040436
Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission 's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?	4.1162229231880945
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	3.3812514018448945
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.	3.3250835320655128
Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise.	4.546074722943865
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	4.015740600182484
In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns.	4.30800824545996
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	5.328482073035249
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	4.239246317652108
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.	4.504207286314131
Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues.	2.92197531300681
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia?	2.827180169793863
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector.	3.327940638644302
I would like to hear the Commissioner 's view on Amendment No 45.	3.8459719104354297
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes.	3.156828121837108
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	3.0936449694509527
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.	3.3255559031750734
Mr President, yesterday ' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.	4.475012485179581
Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today ' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission ' s communications.	5.635093128660488
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	3.12645199214236
It also, of course, finds indirect expression in the question.	3.2123019190100277
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	4.607149726234929
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	4.632886308387474
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union.	3.6533453259260265
But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission.	2.7213718824242235
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	3.9901063361460474
Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.	4.1050990126878855
Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come.	3.4960790803271458
Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old.	2.650670022316966
Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050?	3.545984968197596
The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale.	4.200713947460036
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	2.922050117671274
I cannot answer that question.	4.720136156505137
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test.	5.444692665117781
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	3.9828908540635974
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	3.1194169436488766
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.	3.8761243599155906
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.	3.502893035103053
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change.	4.9104495293128645
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens.	3.014420651525183
On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level.	3.4441550423032816
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.	3.934283636975304
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
The Commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering, an eminently cross-pillar issue.	3.88630039186059
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	4.142737705745763
We are to get the agendas.	4.361408458084594
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	3.256233741246219
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	3.65986773687182
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.	3.33283212990759
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.	4.190476271958661
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that.	3.5574028749263245
Mr President, the Commission 's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved.	4.218234674829093
I say this just so that we know where we stand.	5.702340533274243
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs.	4.752498028312763
Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans.	3.5844362653009703
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.	2.7150280544557366
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.	5.373130104774006
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.	4.5395126341450345
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	5.7898065780046215
(More than twelve Members of Parliament rise to their feet) (Parliament adopted the resolution)	2.471786823368093
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.	4.064389307124741
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	3.7286458685830866
We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing.	3.9050751730826163
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	3.3270295154122294
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union 's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	4.528795805867619
However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation.	3.7345321449859292
Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament.	3.743166801634905
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region!	5.148952977686555
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.	4.059930688566185
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.	3.829730317429333
We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95, and they have already published their corresponding estimates.	3.954248541774447
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.	3.103326732602692
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.	3.6029094703853866
UCITS	2.687904236683331
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States ' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.	4.1904492013118215
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.	4.046451854525659
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.	3.6374211977372375
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	6.855437560208499
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	4.148424206845421
There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner.	4.755630748418236
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	4.022565199876293
The women ' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light.	5.182183020374887
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	4.259454019326209
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	3.7413742712475977
That is not always the case.	2.8942886789604336
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.	3.0495701735147627
The Commission is new and has to be given time, but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission.	5.145284785707247
The Community ' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	4.950819566285523
The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU ' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field.	3.6679833852568997
I refer to Cuba ' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.	3.683525060245138
This seems to be a good thing and useful.	6.565914971877633
However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future.	2.9256905466860115
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.	3.4590440482598233
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	4.164983720701187
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)	1.955698490413183
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.	3.8361854426914777
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.	4.498498683263338
This is important.	4.367294200266054
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	3.793190132193108
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission ' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	4.526172471477186
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	4.087119916732747
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	3.562393679781351
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.	4.64136805601479
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them.	5.479726667658476
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone.	3.919305531196639
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer ' and the reply was 'a black grandmother ' .	3.1492085678531905
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message.	3.953101994612158
Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.	3.474599997447465
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	6.102062419643957
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged.	3.4398231372398027
Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament ' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March.	5.631477086025246
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	3.6331718333017937
- (FR) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety.	4.732609488186514
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	4.228375287212168
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	4.541277432575648
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world.	4.0360877900933785
However, the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned.	4.491181265559162
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision.	3.559754956763263
Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character.	4.376087316938473
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	7.627526371456153
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	3.103991885108914
Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.	3.9132396130809894
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.	4.356150466271416
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge.	5.01733911870344
It is time for action.	4.752004472782556
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how.	4.329361478309553
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House.	4.20284883528775
Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.	3.5893883984507964
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has, in these two short months, organised the first Development Council, admittedly an informal one, whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations. Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered.	3.710550669971245
On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.	3.5773021078613683
This is an important matter.	4.026189962099159
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	5.275495167189634
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action.	3.7807496027301095
We must not waiver in that commitment.	3.8601195955380136
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC.	4.337963411270916
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	3.714577328749447
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.	3.3384685330102424
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	4.472409734252781
What is left, for example, of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny, if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently by you in Portugal, Mr President of the Council.	3.3254704998529965
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.	2.933542680693749
Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.	5.044475838951779
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	4.538891693109288
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	3.419489831659088
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address.	3.7317237270471857
There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.	2.214943761664488
However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations.	3.5506567612357474
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	3.1070866055476345
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	3.7785598131585196
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
The New York stage is different from Geneva.	4.829811268100836
The great majority of the paper 's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.	4.0112043150411685
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	4.74333786732187
Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.	4.458673582294646
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.	4.334016580896102
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.	4.174126944932506
Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital.	3.995366571077821
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.	3.826786899028561
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	3.9912179989774392
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	3.522532878928527
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	4.240492252787206
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.	2.8457094004862395
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.	3.886633740794672
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.	3.625550533167892
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	4.178050858269688
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified.	4.04590568341169
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	3.8533606392060014
What is the Commissioner ' s opinion of this?	3.576478802567963
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?	3.984490623488644
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer ' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	4.161374511821195
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	4.388440585966632
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	3.835427285197504
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	6.308408445789506
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	5.530939908485558
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.	3.095916568618645
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors.	3.3574938270054613
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.	3.1511715700408294
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.	3.6972144976291563
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	4.030716977096315
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.	3.72097900465589
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	4.503615219892339
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.	5.0755638963414595
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	4.661352478024874
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	4.271036831346212
This is not the case here.	4.045856265064193
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.	3.5789073495370483
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	4.370481932313452
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	3.4464524546193998
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities.	5.2151510231911375
Rapid action is called for!	2.6529616825058757
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	3.4137021034728448
Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen.	4.625609512305887
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.	3.765041854892043
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.	3.8468185161729433
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	4.112397083425185
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.	3.3697061271692568
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.	4.430254933136352
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	4.544230331475061
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle.	3.4796221575169057
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.	3.997204515616346
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe ' s most highly-developed regions.	4.012291765333686
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	3.6985254552584657
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues ' instincts are naturally aroused.	3.6739560914259486
Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.	2.8646529754156957
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	5.073401134636493
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.	3.155730612350195
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again.	3.7597288335221326
Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle.	3.627847647687133
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.	3.31649985827265
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.	4.237879177040843
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses.	3.880699029398794
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.	3.9898733604312704
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	4.380315783655643
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	6.294146273829609
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	5.0844906274352475
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	2.5072025258391966
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.	3.841598844872284
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.	4.262726470765232
It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another.	3.2951481315190305
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	5.235767477476472
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	3.823145550920764
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally ' s report.	3.9810639215012897
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.	3.4851852022422753
Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies.	4.053656639551844
The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide.	5.683751876084498
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise.	4.56105770803601
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	4.927964337146045
I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate.	5.445247886249281
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.	3.1204934285262858
Like the work on employment, the Commission ' s proposal is founded upon four pillars.	3.962786038044774
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.	4.408909480075138
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	3.4429891626938955
Therefore, if the regulation is adopted, the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will be made using the new system.	3.2880426974528025
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	3.574606550754235
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	4.946270009915473
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended.	4.260060377666182
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe ' s status in the international system.	4.577933756387787
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	4.54369140329825
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	3.4860258914227487
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution.	4.3706801274506795
For example, it has not been defined.	4.8093550355747
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	2.9188947378156778
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	3.9526482554525817
Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.	3.232574923810082
I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long.	3.25867440642304
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	3.9657770565662736
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	3.7726499423656406
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner ' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration.	4.152350346657743
Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	5.019712073778283
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.	3.101030091430665
Let us just consider for a moment.	2.857083787210996
That has only happened recently.	4.160340125145207
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?	4.587209652449999
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC.	4.3746812963615795
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.	2.8992572690430283
I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time.	4.493357125339683
Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse.	4.234453898831496
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government.	5.077922627221168
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	3.8171846509443497
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	3.0615486119992705
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	4.224252324793384
By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter.	3.656613790130019
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	4.384090521968276
These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie.	3.5582643521753208
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	4.194315820726094
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all, however.	2.9858777338854576
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means.	4.229350016239574
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.	4.7091829390048785
A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector.	4.781409224854538
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory.	4.083735690340887
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry.	3.9631267151500804
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	2.7909547191059505
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.2028131983846255
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	4.54331804805807
We have put down an amendment to that effect.	4.617444702360914
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union ' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	3.6465032262425505
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.	4.271951410257104
I hope that this building will then be occupied.	4.003391724414042
We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU.	4.222525248243543
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	4.854529702515557
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention.	3.6098203330725545
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people ' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission ' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	4.2293054165024175
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	4.785180728545817
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.	4.126494256939333
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	3.044181559473278
. (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme.	4.784442977362832
Regarding the fight against organised crime, 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan, which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations, in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering. And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency ' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.	4.082582155007724
They will take a long time, as we are finding out.	5.182458530837989
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	4.472307435318199
However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.	5.424727758318524
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	3.6163565529705406
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	4.3493795778234805
Why has the Council not informed us of this?	2.8662352108505074
What are we to do now?	2.5757803676886604
We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union.	3.458479198292076
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	5.089371738492627
It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious.	4.590744195937663
That is indeed distortion of the internal market.	2.7807119284085284
In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III ' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument ' s impact, which is its budget.	3.7361468528051467
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	3.219296486653008
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry ' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?	4.977044339251865
The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans.	3.7078857849896014
Thank you for your statement.	2.2849756071137866
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it.	5.851602141368665
When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market, we must also deal with the darker side, namely bankruptcies.	4.69506891329958
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	4.080220067358662
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	3.284081546818839
Furthermore, it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.	4.13719663095556
You mentioned 'women ' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	4.313495484727486
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.	5.361195954425356
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	3.942170339537874
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	4.4111936812527155
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides.	3.616325975487817
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.	4.35788717182661
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future.	5.117316428204923
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	4.489858777470035
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission ' s opinion.	5.148759320923302
I am anxious to know how effective the EU ' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	4.012087931829036
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	3.319031276081443
This objective deserves our total support.	4.507454360587912
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	3.249315582398208
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	4.426717549344679
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this.	5.163559549107502
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.	3.3421514380514585
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.	4.283552522597992
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.	3.802188782603386
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.	3.569219001968748
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stands for.	3.7252411887283023
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.	3.136083079928551
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	4.496999003107007
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	3.7682312040220562
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent.	4.76618226268572
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.	5.021994672954202
The term 'tourism ' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.	3.8752836984201906
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council.	4.351942501975806
And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us.	3.8768119578913907
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	5.701190992343558
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	3.272549875614703
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed.	4.424332209486978
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency.	4.2412425110347804
You are lucky that Mr Böge ' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so.	4.115759812188848
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out, bit by bit, because the elderly live too long, leading to problems with pension payments.	3.092504623405633
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	3.7948124067201436
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	4.4196841592555565
In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	4.052591346939671
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point.	4.180625118771688
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	3.737452447995705
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted.	4.400958962347686
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission 's work?	4.039925999480737
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.	3.698955217040438
We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment.	3.6240261286084596
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities ' (UCITS) can invest.	3.62373890664164
Mrs Schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	4.146964708806867
In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage.	4.060374627989255
However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve.	3.4847977296186246
Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources.	3.3375526089678598
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	3.6578325857460174
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.	4.2113973151446
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.	4.019043135860379
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.6488263573675483
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal.	3.668577821698924
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.	4.186554989719114
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.	4.915188086832654
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	4.64526481496683
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation.	5.566401308090478
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	3.598034798927704
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights.	5.4871637215864375
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe 's response to the BSE crisis.	3.997034906155854
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	2.6298493093054116
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.	2.246256421711979
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	4.6860627353466
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	3.129450517563448
Finally, I thank you again for this debate.	3.737868247484016
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.	3.8681981856333216
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago, the difference between then and now is like that between night and day, despite difficulties and delays.	3.607738314372007
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective.	5.08268915258692
There are reputable companies too.	3.6667325252729412
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".	4.217915418282983
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	2.7680270506390774
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	3.3587316250917563
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way.	4.144071675041003
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.	3.199513862082302
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million.	3.1420147603894826
Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas.	3.5833929464116245
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	3.881763382192851
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	5.924508105127285
Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne.	3.4598491497518578
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.	3.087029719710714
Our priorities (i.e. the "left-overs" ) must be:	3.2831380761025475
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future.	4.740028689566687
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	4.188251536433677
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved.	3.3304525570752324
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	4.138025076542022
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.	3.2069624413017137
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome.	2.843529805580018
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria.	4.37846716470686
In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.	3.5956313063076455
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	3.5360526894979105
In my view, and I say this quite clearly, the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused.	3.983135109013695
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 and 16.	3.5548510120316883
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	4.61888081798819
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work.	3.389731690914053
Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council ' s draft directive.	3.8752356236017524
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.	4.757477714844565
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.	4.311825559099836
We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told.	3.7763872733286266
The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy.	4.713431393173781
- (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy.	3.106124277710016
Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction.	2.6365822261953396
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	4.7412117853962
In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services.	4.829965468916354
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	4.674162174334934
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	3.6280138372989805
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.	4.358678943388482
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report.	3.672334699893096
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	7.743231220908705
In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis?	4.116969138377894
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement.	3.7845559119486305
However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used.	3.986986840952269
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries.	4.15096347065085
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State.	4.092305184410206
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.	4.737753664906449
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums.	3.752855873407244
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards.	4.434287395117685
We are to know who is on each committee.	4.39227616780366
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	2.2103604266191277
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	3.8107583035253922
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.	4.767781803410361
It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP ' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.	3.801876373236703
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	4.893587971265371
In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence.	4.772915862787718
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems.	4.04703771417093
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.	3.668604780963305
We have achieved a compromise solution.	4.6851436306034495
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.	4.235802595113642
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	2.7805775954233956
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.	5.204680701403894
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.	4.762260880629041
I just have one more request.	4.9765228755202005
Has any thought been given to the matter?	3.1394433063146048
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another.	3.9661746605670505
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	4.843025453962842
And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently.	4.641158876563144
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit.	5.553112777179274
I therefore hope, firstly, that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other.	4.985309197520022
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	4.643545781979925
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people.	5.608734256111283
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	4.089399075990044
We all know that!	4.640433789819846
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense.	4.437680708544623
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	4.227094897908704
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation.	4.043398864878814
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.	4.477717459221398
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.	4.589531684637402
They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union ' s political will.	4.3573801834843
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue.	2.368027827864196
We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures.	3.5936477810231953
This is a big problem in my opinion.	3.903368796398955
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	4.90163981653668
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals.	4.439074295894643
In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.	4.161749564696635
Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it.	3.2990013890732652
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region.	4.137573309857522
Will Syria fully accept Israel ' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law?	3.214910341067673
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	4.0242975547680775
I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.	4.483307189836107
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.	3.3978599035982056
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.9838430135809453
Mr Medina Ortega, I naturally share your concerns and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own, the country currently holding the presidency, is naturally very concerned about this issue, all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own.	3.9248538594413414
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	3.4142531738224595
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.	7.1182223817979855
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.	4.639670244939034
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	5.254308820061699
I think they should have.	6.345465026128962
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	3.7063106119287457
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	5.1238353673740615
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months.	4.206402781182023
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past.	3.4930417038346238
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks.	2.487810639378723
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission ' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission ' s accountability for the future.	4.105952455257704
There is a need for more coordination, more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided.	3.747202723152261
Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country ' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations.	5.069842737735423
We must clearly set firm objectives.	3.7203256933619673
Relating to Friday: President.	1.898094441316745
We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.	4.324816247724939
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends.	6.323122407501102
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	5.407158345101902
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d ' être, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.	4.399501832045343
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	2.973827364934769
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission 's administration with the public.	6.163252623787055
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	4.409552879339387
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new; the Commission can approve these.	3.077363132959232
First of all the report reveals Parliament ' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.	5.174837100807318
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	4.612109658893292
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on.	4.282882442298355
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	4.97258014704298
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.	4.279894931403223
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	4.495292875030763
This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen.	3.785973729477579
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns.	4.75808025102675
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	4.20621353299364
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	4.932002935393388
First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers.	3.410769939563876
We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is.	4.388187680781505
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.	5.477691149876535
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future.	3.7094027823668627
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.	4.804069737073592
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	3.5205114687265673
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	3.0457738919735875
Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse.	4.257172559500653
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	3.6327398032327003
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.	3.0333695105225305
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason.	3.96298392104756
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission.	3.3948959448348766
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	2.9988316725149304
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.	4.637033247864745
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	3.6250670568425623
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.	4.3150276942470045
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year?	3.37776809709005
Are these reports accurate?	3.5095417263643878
It is shameful!	5.407653033474227
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.	3.262229228867621
You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	3.5967536412721546
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	2.939238123430023
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.	4.50328105131804
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union.	5.796137780599841
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	3.7623396509284484
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	5.842131378846657
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	4.361925612561347
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.	3.54785708652773
We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April.	4.208179011266248
According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations.	4.06867726458608
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique.	3.3704522991801227
The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market.	3.584695284334975
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	4.76910904010853
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.	3.86261144506216
I look forward to Parliament ' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward.	4.300048968901662
We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone.	3.3367586093545003
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.	3.9512633883526616
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements.	4.585701490858676
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens ' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.	3.961344447177186
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery.	3.7593962026051195
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health.	5.048746272993544
The lion ' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements.	3.413104762555165
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	3.4766596135331365
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	3.943014542298689
The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation.	4.6610698771903145
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders.	4.08943449077646
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today.	4.7779328587277154
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	3.9766831864386885
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report.	3.046007979281753
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	2.8366285374282523
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit.	2.9961191676184575
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.	2.923556478198011
Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right.	2.5650498035350244
In my judgement, this constitutes a guarantee to both sides, both from a political and a financial point of view, of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.	5.324140682424664
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	5.720518878355111
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.	5.908711354379631
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe ' s positive roles in history.	3.8285406348214903
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner.	4.299254229204566
Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified.	3.446132992640171

Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.	3.626445598937045
We insist on this.	5.096027356552958
This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively.	5.411982564241255
True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system.	4.482612628721961

Food safety	2.22481123362017
Take the trade agreements.	2.301969379059476
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.	4.11440521634089
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	3.2171696173758817
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.	3.112224247813595
I am glad to see that Parliament ' s amendments have focused upon this.	3.751935136217198
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership, which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.	3.440468271952708
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.	3.5404465372943377
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	4.095887739350637
One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy ' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people.	4.1271964318533065
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO.	4.9952024901574195
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	5.96478236031183
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices.	4.841822740525105
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate.	4.998709801622656
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	4.2497579260682095
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.	4.540878470745183
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.	4.030547266164013
They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors.	3.9618870128963652
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet.	3.6905265918263197
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	3.309325035974258
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	3.3399440640442966
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	4.464349679932109
By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious.	3.4389648537129816
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	3.3736975951566794
Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.	4.297786007251901
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.	4.530622619304253
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.	4.60777517829353
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.	4.128645553588131
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	4.705844341073251
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries.	3.163255003381214
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.	5.832939482430607
The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas?	3.580155536551599
Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this.	4.30008145675152
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.	3.2207021718076203
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	4.913310293042667
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.	4.168509995332652
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side.	3.33756307380744
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.	3.4916463394986983
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training.	3.534120176236952
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.	3.5839162871555446
The shift in meaning is not just semantic. The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for.	3.9057706297757395
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.	3.7206127546692507
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.	5.010185104681297
Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future.	3.719601415809084
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	5.05765183937651
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	3.6042696161397125
But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual.	4.795446965604469
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants.	3.9459206697700493
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.	4.371169568003491
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	2.913925822747377
According to the Commission ' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.	3.141433762719237
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa.	3.8307719289492814
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	4.312968094822312
This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal.	3.6323749911955403
After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time.	4.360366852316897
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.	3.2745071741718865
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.	3.792676586323243
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.	3.947074733597959
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People 's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	4.310253116659022
However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements.	4.148001697266647
This report is very good and our Group supports it.	4.9189778812124665
Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group ' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success.	4.966888062807185
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	4.269307703912424
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits.	3.8194252565610793
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.	4.072430367480002
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments.	5.613991209611173
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	3.9145157686624916
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	5.1652541994682215
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	3.507346632114115
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.	3.9512436494501713
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer.	4.680891080836674
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt ' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament.	4.9714947172266895
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999.	3.195064907877413
Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually.	2.9406004037500693
If this happens, the United States ' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.	4.874841523737021
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.	5.329700553424222
Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in.	4.20058655774684
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings.	4.317160679942532
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	3.4028983438588614
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly.	4.056642322134962
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	4.235458211795691
I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors.	4.701415140473352
We have to be aware of this.	3.9651882708791137
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	4.366234528457641
We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process.	4.699486609417719
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.	2.669582953209706
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	4.127569720999787
In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement.	3.615862848208593
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	5.170208156465033
If you are, when exactly are you going to do it?	3.413153251903085
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.	4.36468435509359
Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well.	4.0336838973606906
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	3.6583116302613257
That is the way it should be.	4.95844283357671
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	4.81794787109214
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	3.5596460878066676
In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area.	5.337705251913607
Already stretched resources are being further stretched.	3.0585894768240944
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words, and I quote, "of the highest possible standard" are replaced by "are safe" .	3.663860212097116
In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars.	4.425780414493629
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.	3.0752185582927627
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community.	3.4058492876208617
This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens.	4.678066460350195
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	4.173437390991283
You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away.	3.1231736077722263
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.	3.2721027785637458
This applies to them and us.	4.399134694467384
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised.	5.381363772541066
The Community initiative means community involvement.	4.298682811742351
The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat.	4.142701106198315
In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission ' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property.	4.624649913713031
Indeed, these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions, people who cannot return to their homes after the storms, purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist. They are no longer there, having been swept away in the torrents.	3.3110023406096785
In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state.	4.908278862799802
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.	5.016073698499767
May he rest in peace.	2.7994868030484374
These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary.	3.9362895026195535
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves.	3.8500357263153298
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.	4.210673983022888
As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners.	3.3489596597288402
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter.	3.5381652056390633
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources.	3.8745937286070222
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	3.784553290092935
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council ' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	3.2361655174498023
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country.	4.42222170153768
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	3.055703390984614
The difficult part, which will fall to the Convention, is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties.	4.158519048816031
Could the Commissioner answer two questions.	2.521212365383409
After all, innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding.	2.9122021251780987
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons.	5.55695567115061
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.	4.582515820818764
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	3.5954447265354323
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	3.181826081392783
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	4.3756934647155665
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China.	4.264965931060137
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives.	5.514893658329832
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards.	4.5755635920709095
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	4.82978232646265
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	3.6456716575965253
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April.	4.365194889247564
I thank them for their statements to the House.	4.467077412582755
In fact, we were shaken by it.	3.678259940087128
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	4.076579874997708
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	3.8214073277597835
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.	4.246677090917689
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	3.7717064030355814
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	4.066608124852521
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement.	4.333728177608621
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.992161753473742
Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental ' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury.	3.778644242577872
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	5.453407116221283
It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy.	5.1836598563840734
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.	3.954255761518839
Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this?	3.832639352178282
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.	4.452315323013576
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union ' s dependence on imported energy.	3.9948068098079603
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.	3.820951576710085
What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide.	3.454583609293599
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.	3.6502731357552203
As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate.	3.5007519811182526
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	4.72532988339306
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.	4.493183546221478
Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise?	4.555596722155438
Some of them have already lost several years ' worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea.	2.933673168673644
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.	4.389207591953556
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	4.828964588344814
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament ' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them.	3.852795033491302
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	4.625428701477067
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions.	5.4570502198773445
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel.	4.225403628419481
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.	3.0221958926595205
The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.	4.184388568545473
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework.	3.5307528836113242
The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	3.276467348955967
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.	4.392609054631381
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	3.434235078251592
I also reject this line of argument.	4.905169056497873
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen.	3.2114702037586915
This, however, does not seem feasible.	2.8161075021327395
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	3.8700246181464504
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy.	3.4884683853822285
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade.	4.747834495441783
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	3.3347078280000444
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO.	3.5484500367032945
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	2.5078850601669225
In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances.	3.5122753992153366
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	4.735894965897711
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People 's Party or does the Austrian People 's Party continue to sit in that political group?	3.3668081958737845
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	4.738186059985484
It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed.	3.8809214333103172
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.	4.964452030712915
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	4.097546559213134
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	3.3270600675564848
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.	3.9784808167932257
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	4.235161184587923
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.	4.596950120692267
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	3.4570334795627935
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.	4.38368543821043
That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.	3.9216558511169843
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	3.2149677807977355
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	3.8702098574406154
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	5.034722243906206
So it is a step forward.	3.703312077992958
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit.	5.065111305674545
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.	2.965507002587711
We want to encourage debate among the people.	3.371821151477759
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.	3.3794962198645737
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.	4.196853421276717
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	5.43901998307362
All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected.	4.0552799868335585
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the "jewel in the crown" of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.9201340779955203
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.	5.9552477957396945
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment.	3.7761746896503734
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.	3.517636108499831
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	3.4841606962393232
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner.	3.1214722355558666
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	3.0527053210657678
For this reason, it is essential that the Council ' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.	3.7769799609121217
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	2.0591229677513136
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision.	4.668555743058399
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.	4.267723128231771
Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG!	3.3933077926928803
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	3.9357305888364134
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	3.4925195913048475
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.	5.028340008875914
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach.	3.7460422339739945
There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner ' s efforts to return Kosovo ' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive.	4.404763776890882
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	3.637860825702868
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	3.749998149039773
In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises?	4.016938359924943
The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one.	3.5777061215483075
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world ' s most dynamic and competitive regions.	4.240677174245959
Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved.	3.6287505203407076
However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme ' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision.	3.7475995496302423
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.	6.543082713845844
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.	3.8648476927043034
I am in favour of social protection, I am in favour of the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high.	4.26896283544777
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein ' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.	4.0347589392376175
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	3.7842738922925623
. Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility ' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries.	4.091469872171965
Result: a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself.	3.078700975276462
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers ' money in Europe.	4.561434880919
My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility.	3.246880067092807
I find the opposite the case.	5.163434655878829
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.	4.564110509398473
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.	3.875235348579964
One is subsidiarity.	3.666689681893331
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	3.286676099626398
It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated.	3.140988666430278
Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security.	2.390152379048453
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	5.188205537160913
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union ' s blessing.	4.200716883969024
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies ' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion.	3.0354427239098247
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.	3.8948993734259174
Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem.	4.693622021190786
Where is the beef?	1.6603375509415645
It is his first report here in plenary.	3.5725024638551566
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	3.549341266427928
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	3.840807442347697
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough.	4.2575401062797225
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today 's agenda.	3.751464728607148
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	2.4476527730812623
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	4.627939102966387
Soon, in May, the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union ' s external relations.	5.455381570606285
I emphasise the word 'could ' , and that is if it is done well and with care.	5.757049858826352
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	3.362587453594827
The documents will in the main be open working documents.	5.061944233322705
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	2.8715117208025367
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	4.4589350424636605
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell.	4.167622341998644
Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party.	4.6148368618828135
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament 's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	3.3859349092191646
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	3.595237546807714
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States ' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	3.9935851176597215
Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.	3.3296409774668403
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	5.883491100716977
This question has now entered a different dimension, a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments, no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy.	3.256699482587622
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	3.9022104965608246
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence.	4.34053413966426
I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.	5.737240279046919
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	4.3219498929315785
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.	4.409291056680965
First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.	4.278998887617541
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.	4.7491275425784085
In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.	3.3621156691263847
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.	5.268566438354666
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.	4.010955566965183
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	4.023411350813889
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	4.669161899495811
We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.	4.2574310376144595
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court.	4.737090066033847
I would therefore urge the Council ' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide.	4.881442268284673
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry.	3.614808258191087
One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area, for example and the United States, is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here.	4.941008331123322
In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted.	5.04317214311825
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	3.6864128176024504
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	3.8163309706453203
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.6688069022930805
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.5058264775679655
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.	2.3899717652313184
Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances.	2.5512378608622757
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson.	2.8545037263059583
This is the theory behind it, anyway.	3.7006319609790257
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.	4.676610919837292
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution.	3.8393930790053243
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	4.953976671140487
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them.	3.9578486825837635
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	4.227582742567
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	3.1664529031438997
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP.	3.487814909346764
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	4.205289650944809
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.	3.482578437195355
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	4.34913991482741
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.	3.292265499366775
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	3.4556385607215514
No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.	3.2925512180214036
Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.	4.319254971394361
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	3.1866106042345974
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need.	2.676711576346794
I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner ' s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.	3.631010605329668
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity.	3.6517738143301783
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	3.88272522446731
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission ' s response to our requests and demands.	3.3680761214636084
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.	3.419507680753917
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.	4.521502500720811
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.	3.343376319912639
However, the main concern remains .	3.628561659121802
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.	3.5150838477644095
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave.	4.029993537125247
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract.	3.9896590076551424
I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period "before" and "after" NATO ' s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time.	3.2453487718853284
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays ' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment.	3.784722064076411
And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content.	4.808149309178847
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	3.827601793517504
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.	4.729313213762235
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament ' s prerogatives and competences.	5.124388625265702
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.	5.232692928424304
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action.	3.335001275994473
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report.	3.104310314807008
If certain countries wish to use the words "former Yugoslavia" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them.	3.641682807425868
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	4.109175930185362
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	4.053698132671154
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety, for example, are nonsense.	4.186070786167034
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem.	4.409183974920893
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons!	4.145117507304081
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	2.679723546894678
Firstly: a regulatory framework is needed, which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens.	3.096203050637894
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	6.002636017161464
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	2.8738778360444788
The nations, regions, towns and communities of Europe will be preserved.	4.398637772343296
Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries ' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries.	3.95552643443933
Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.	3.8624496158610553
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.	3.700715649984194
The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought.	3.8737722886330777
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO ' s unity.	3.8155819814536547
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use.	4.832617891784321
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	4.328211387372175
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!	1.8594178414905538
The goal of the Commission ' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection.	5.106286303686451
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	5.001856459975647
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	3.790545852070406
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin.	4.456431622072981
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	5.272784864589665
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?	3.215001193055283
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.	4.910713335687924
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly.	4.172739174748284
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	3.9333341479809634
It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself.	3.6991612772470415
Water, in this context, is a commercial commodity.	2.8160637835256868
We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one.	4.335209419639863
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance.	4.13056120113547
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	3.858533598140808
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need.	5.9644752976029665
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off.	3.800208172903379
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	5.270707530178638
Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was.	3.5391433889441517
That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.	3.1683364836847874
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket?	3.6608515353652025
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	4.7966146516075225
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	4.41985880033127
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road.	3.413181279269164
My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.	2.5665117838315483
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	3.862029277511601
As far as we are concerned, they will be.	2.8289731015639217
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977.	3.7275948539644768
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society.	4.2837516186882585
Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.	3.7269971796118613
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.	3.035270119796592
The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.	4.092314740509866
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making.	4.962267498850219
McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	2.0579069076976073
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal.	2.4742190206295884
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	6.891158980062586
Madam President, today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles.	4.373084579234022
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	3.668580066807382
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	3.1845629634525223
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	3.7938305786112467
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions.	3.980443236967263
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)	1.9451468837011094
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	3.0301243445415853
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough.	2.6043857349474497
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	3.9830439217251894
I therefore support the Commission ' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation.	4.978873432989737
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	4.197646008961053
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	4.793051629822478
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.	3.245778968469153
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	3.5638805315197835
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	4.308878495933704
Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people.	2.4794596961168147
The first is asylum.	4.651547990936295
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.	3.3115173759058236
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	3.5718955787942344
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	4.5555127646028
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.	2.900111635885734
. Yes, Mr President, that is true.	4.204383569882829
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result.	3.775403998570014
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?	3.909738172593422
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo ' s speech set here.	3.611030450126082
Such is life.	3.573828548799809
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.	5.2429158457974525
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	4.099579588788111
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	7.266327191486152
Not to save jobs.	2.980334589737718
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.	3.3328518291139404
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.	5.615434142411953
Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature.	2.528317484473186
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado.	3.8194227591541825
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	4.850551344795835
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people.	4.131231758306248
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.	5.053833996480867
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign?	3.263498649312902
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	4.482329407026811
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	3.945462392845453
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	3.4524701567175646
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	3.741605461050439
ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals.	2.8350765727107676
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.	3.6871011045459414
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report.	3.1725429991156977
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	2.7133449962922342
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.	3.9606850386995487
Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset.	3.0012402539019276
That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard.	3.89650325022243
Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.	2.99022216328984
More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation.	4.2281906944192675
In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	4.523127161888063
The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control.	4.172480064950666
The common fisheries policy is not working.	7.397186512226162
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.	3.71579652119745
The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.	3.9273470722072426
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	3.9787222065683188
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	5.32460846222085
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points.	5.122728226050225
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore .	5.815839511523017
The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters.	3.352343748189297
Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance.	3.7408731779345423
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	4.084955425759182
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	3.4878967088055632
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	3.5835741225570583
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system.	4.446679153212617
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	4.979395501036092
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union ' s enlargement.	5.675149742121983
Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy.	3.581605154902178
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.	3.6136864111288465
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.	4.761063285295688
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage.	5.066266786563478
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	3.4166958732210233
They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources.	3.8723766816954885
I await with interest developments in Cuba.	4.6862714333787645
Madam President, my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission ' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate, instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary.	4.0076929461429165
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.	4.413898233436476
So much for the quality.	2.9806107826595376
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	3.3481379652198973
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	3.798908118351251
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström ' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness.	3.744129048452559
Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes.	2.9937893879719635
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	2.7600866259167924
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question.	4.505444219583262
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider 's adherents.	3.8303666735277573
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.	3.544847953252482
When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.	3.5849540785582246
If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation.	4.330157127375482
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	4.454707416717133
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed.	3.467989360020632
It is up to the Commission ' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach.	4.951627100151939
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	3.901936000481559
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	4.339494214876686
Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.	3.4063117517017942
Nevertheless, I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition, which will evidently imply some concessions.	3.6158217864442
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us.	3.8321182007425882
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland.	3.3949111534551175
In the capacity of coordinator of the European People ' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into.	3.8626019755069354
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?	4.047737169384111
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.	3.337561956152406
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.	3.239232260424236
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution.	4.7266941910048255
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees.	4.178806329612266
. (EL) On reading the Commission ' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality.	4.483965752524664
But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested, for example, by China ' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China ' s human rights record.	3.6562825590693553
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	6.000640316663905
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.	3.413529623540363
Reform of European competition policy	3.0058448914154594
And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues: firstly, comitology, an ongoing debate within this House, but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament.	3.565037953815177
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery.	3.144863309017105
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process.	3.5461557099626226
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.	4.56821846825859
As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets.	3.130605069960014
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.	3.827224687379311
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.	3.2994822755754254
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.	3.948158164082916
I do not know what the metric equivalent is.	3.529037159975433
Are there any comments?	1.2692975256400874
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.	3.7790947100511163
It is before Parliament for second reading.	4.024835667350644
But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself?	4.856086745352165
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.	4.51453874994737
I want to refer to the political position here.	5.422642679798574
What should this global actor ' s objective be?	4.071961059364753
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	3.9025986250194906
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well?	2.9563632285235597
I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House.	3.8773877470742613
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted.	2.9156335487898484
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	3.807751957757022
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	4.031874294962588
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise.	2.760238944484593
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy.	3.8466517775293436
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	6.608155374269247
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States.	3.8544420062079587
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union ' s development policy.	3.4325823429261813
On the whole, I welcome the committee 's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann 's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.	4.007946389559645
It will become totally invisible!	4.640355654791036
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union.	4.187311762323615
Mr President, I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair, in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative.	3.9899656052217733
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue.	3.6400766933240543
I was told that this was a personal response.	5.83859938995921
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	3.9134293131161138
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.	5.873115364188688
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections.	3.5995467390013713
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences.	4.22349598088567
Justice needs to be done in East Timor.	2.802065855973593
We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency.	3.331879585158491
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	4.417144883059414
We should not be so politically partisan.	5.048137965393794
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	4.222009521367247
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.9838430135809453
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.	4.241407242037458
Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	3.120765904760396
Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize.	3.9097362340850768
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky ' s whereabouts and his state of health.	3.7525869365728775
After this interesting exchange of opinions, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing.	3.0752613681522445
We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe.	4.535564111252018
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	2.905498498026967
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.	4.471608741219489
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself. As I have told Parliament, the task before us is immense and ambitious, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge.	4.224730985514753
And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content.	4.76118786910043
The Commission ' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point.	4.41810857154997
The motion also asks that a position document, drawn up by the Commission and Council, should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF.	4.756563321579605
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect.	3.163420309001952
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates.	4.643617057377931
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission ' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	4.293044491487366
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.	3.1255046738160774
We are to know when they meet.	3.915461718780021
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate.	4.039642950497321
Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget.	4.356838530604791
In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks.	4.268518910038982
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans.	3.952908113842017
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?	3.4160391200190356
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.	2.819832304378728
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.	3.353588788500209
It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	3.8289538871909876
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.	4.831636880246954
However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market.	4.193690537253032
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality.	2.901317866739328
If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security.	3.624358763990901
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	3.8425576326355344
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there.	5.752284054095194
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	3.358215977369035
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products.	3.440154847816336
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes.	2.8758146862629514
What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased.	3.7860359618503177
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	4.1131807683360915
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	3.473441907784353
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	5.618639053133267
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	5.064667351763862
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?	2.8139808607841728
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	4.128568367968977
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques ' .	2.8969767990209068
This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment.	6.186513182088311
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	5.221999771940355
Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.	4.144414904505801
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.	6.114069951069896
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	3.79816096211803
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone 's standards.	3.1220848933247427
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.	3.6735161460450985
Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world.	3.1767065057669512
If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance	3.6941237606373347
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries.	2.50215961518274
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	5.410680609657116
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.	4.156879908011722
I have two further points to make on this process.	4.298476498841004
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?	3.82630729922178
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.	3.7290001157968127
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	2.0317371781454012
Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report.	2.6635687920832236
The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy.	3.177464309052968
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD.	3.382173092114502
With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency.	3.770121872686235
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni ' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council ' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology.	4.56130442929265
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	3.9785935409847215
I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again.	4.157559913360529
Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	4.856981185980421
In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas.	4.460550095148344
I very much welcome the Commission 's support for that bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about.	3.7763223944348376
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	5.097467259497401
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights.	3.643939521896948
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally.	4.300964196841829
I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence.	4.4031747678036535
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	3.1795802482050872
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved.	2.1368001616880186
These are the modern means to be used.	3.1338894637387558
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	3.910980189589696
In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched.	3.718682751438306
Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context.	4.370014089924461
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	4.648731626139241
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax.	4.132779434673707
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.	4.922654949007304
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	3.0446646946680227
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.	4.4972213460395505
What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues.	3.9974938895185246
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	3.9155998001505523
However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.	3.719042691980819
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	4.213000569556192
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation.	2.7611207520074426
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down.	3.698711838091249
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe ' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	5.19313399641999
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate.	4.337842455703874
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.	5.214213148771217
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique?	4.114695156597409
For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola.	2.977197625284522
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.	4.059865417791861
There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.	3.081507947218997
Firstly, Mr President, although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency, it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction.	4.027254329644122
What should we do with the shredded products?	4.569003867033939
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate.	4.162338808676162
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	3.670739709024884
The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council.	5.166052353334454
I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service.	4.158176786459645
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.	3.4962749658387997
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.	4.9104002689940645
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.	4.669432607807127
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.	3.8917431605835344
Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann ' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council ' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice.	3.848674736797436
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	3.698382848125764
I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.	4.608347690841033
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text.	5.147706856910833
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	5.692106583095396
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.	4.469881794267076
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject.	3.1304078638793067
It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.	4.299744887283778
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.	5.208673860438388
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.	3.9224604327105976
As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme ' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this.	4.4534669224028685
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.	3.82111625344104
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	3.8235707224110076
They have all been available on the Commission ' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested.	3.849675651489205
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.	4.333650853327183
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English.	3.5450123187937166
Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created.	4.1988019597557695
Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force.	3.9785966709113736
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	4.048008908811203
From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean.	3.8052982372445916
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	4.429062211978755
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6283050878427754
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.	4.754160149176435
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe.	3.3864226326171574
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament.	4.3678901870852895
States can carry out port inspections.	2.4321104574592467
Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000)	2.168223356581669
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.	3.7809745369753336
We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level.	3.5251707964738976
An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society.	3.1074421727712167
On the issue of Palestine, I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement.	5.3318784143867965
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.	3.0103651735924557
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	3.9910589152408344
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.	5.0216538298889555
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence, because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend, we will have to remember that, for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 are contributed by the European Union.	4.2378471048541675
In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people.	3.4376049384639518
That needs to be addressed.	4.770606946150307
When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.	4.207061567766901
In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data.	3.8458375541929537
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	3.8440012555513667
I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary.	4.071216576012803
To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty.	4.866014574931146
But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	3.183328694217519
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	3.7159399483514535
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials.	3.2084559825707415
As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough.	3.4231433851672013
As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.	4.4982791729525315
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	4.025560299651273
Talks in Austria on forming a government	2.2381414801479544
Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information.	3.8819364737853888
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.	3.6375871569669673
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.	3.3636686029546023
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism.	3.011915694247733
And a woman was elected.	3.7681705623618753
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival.	3.95405376650714
This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone.	4.414089684896305
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people.	3.8006240619867167
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission.	4.87675100778213
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs.	2.941295118980007
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	5.4909443369744935
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.	5.180697787530982
In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.	3.9505943877034504
In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	4.32147037522836
Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous.	3.463869274151191
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament ' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	3.9815194246225967
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.	3.108750035451299
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	4.953733184754983
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.	4.371502643587836
B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	2.4922464055361724
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	3.2808468324336215
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems.	4.314166444666862
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.	3.867467968699028
In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate.	5.179525174048028
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries ' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	3.3870684800311532
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report.	3.5939299650479293
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	2.5792760325686688
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	5.028800450936095
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.	3.765189866212525
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	3.4775529619965844
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	3.5991046833627234
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?	4.268464597689199
I do not have these concerns.	4.6300820598986006
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.	3.564135436133995
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.	4.6918978356972
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	4.448304516692429
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	4.267058459568618
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.	3.0968762972531327
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	4.71417532365125
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons.	4.248313755063093
In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded.	4.1395929251822245
I think that your proposal, Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote separate, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date, is a reasonable one.	4.3310500252514865
Let us point out that Parliament ' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	4.1070795404494636
I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints.	7.00590442063312
Nevertheless, I must make it clear that all these actions will, of course, have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries, so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	3.320787911939974
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	4.489788328633441
Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence.	4.502873653259909
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter.	3.6054700273603335
Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.	4.95632989344726
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee ' s work?	2.990486118243781
In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate.	5.045790123508613
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates.	5.770361420408448
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection.	4.737039352606745
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	2.9642235153979253
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.	4.524210860739114
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers ' liability.	5.198234935743676
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament.	2.652411694455304
The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures.	5.049648348199309
In any event, Article 255 does not, at first sight, allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity.	3.398825285758403
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	3.863055967999176
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur ' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	4.703831573140882
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	4.527273874184279
Would this be in the interests of Europe 's citizens?	4.197367129392551
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	5.347689563889129
It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff.	3.6938631914446063
(Parliament approved the request)	2.81150473988232
In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport.	3.3502948052230623
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace.	4.0530046704753815
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.	4.941530502611546
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.	4.640209214377095
I would also like to say that the European Parliament ' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented.	4.266663694432904
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	4.4276439611659315
If this is not to be a mere media event, it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee, the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed.	5.698719990325846
This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated.	3.4134559948809504
After years of 'good and loyal service ' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries.	3.863269374855175
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.	3.430408812123161
However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws.	5.120513930039986
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.	3.960493526184343
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.	4.122837266404693
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO 's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo 's minority communities.	3.2288896257689106
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	3.7465318708507453
My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions.	3.0581506383029144
But, Mr Marinos, in the EU context, culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas.	4.527674906161202
The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues.	4.356717761741534
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.	4.493495523290223
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.	3.5629508899628317
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	3.7160832748117145
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	3.5418439121328604
Thirdly, to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite.	3.546692680608816
Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland ' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others.	4.838387735433302
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.	3.498651892658405
It is a miracle that they were saved.	4.598797868071466
This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States.	5.2326358201803265
Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	2.5326159937591277
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	4.285214905176845
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.	4.534935821309888
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.	3.737923287242875
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute?	3.993655584708299
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established?	4.8068293835002365
In fact, it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer ' s liability.	3.9127991556741395
Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes.	3.4966170865268857
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed.	4.250287462082886
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	4.824287158465782
I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler ' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted.	4.392263740611959
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows.	4.275325352919659
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.	3.9064313549925083
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States.	3.995426083323243
. (DA) The Left ' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN.	3.177555468903305
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	3.9735345457366016
As this is the first Valentine ' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease, the biggest killer in the European Union.	4.059176563291273
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	3.7628997640176105
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni.	3.368157489366694
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime.	3.464313329739005
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved.	3.9980060756966997
In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions.	4.568549018367888
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.	4.111869516366092
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	4.552629572633387
Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force. We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy.	3.1290506378225253
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force.	3.026017609116125
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.	3.000980667114511
But NATO ' s decision for military intervention and the KLA ' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.	4.144614830174007
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.	3.8041540448107867
The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and, above all, the future of fishery products, an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years, now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs, unfortunately, of initial disenchantment.	3.8205714839913063
When an autonomous region 's or country 's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.	3.2649528265931287
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	5.572694850378638
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.	3.3928393284239395
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.	3.449323520717906
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement.	4.465550148426155
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?	4.593132792245542
In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.	3.8519070053827535
All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report.	4.198990956999636
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	4.771735769526459
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	4.2350393226192296
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)	2.363078363712714
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	5.243666558083546
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.	4.164613301923909
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	5.5253451188759275
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies.	4.556620618306438
Deviating from the Council ' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	2.7404874189438866
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	4.197889643769866
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	3.608602476898317
Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.	3.921397443606859
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	4.659916026997675
It was this practice which led to the Commission ' s downfall.	5.504529014894196
As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report.	3.0197364359941985
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community ' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation.	4.920837368958844
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	3.561367380226768
For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena.	4.188913492324341
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly.	4.029694399129686
Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand.	3.0023585215362396
The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever.	4.051427693753218
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	2.9060644855492326
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	4.13483524522491
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	2.850490331176344
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.	3.7709097141972827
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.	3.142172667364262
The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets.	5.107193908999653
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment.	3.1259206918868836
Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD ' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level.	3.313800135176507
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	3.9270915587741673
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake.	4.127143888765965
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
I would also like to remind Members that, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition, which is an important point - sooner or later, as part of its own pre-accession strategy, have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time, and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety.	3.998287768655019
Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people ' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion.	3.450058586053032
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	3.9120567728041062
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	3.3100610406292055
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	3.8302809175310855
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	3.521905080359545
We are to get the documents that are sent to them.	3.7261376689659
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.	2.842855874570222
The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.	4.186960139288825
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives.	3.981094592024785
Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.	3.2142152059919056
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	4.591288300341169
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	2.7397108464816213
May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallström to Mr Martin?	2.9216693098198703
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	4.544909350835934
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	4.12891716205593
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	4.479859124987931
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	3.052789636112022
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	3.7265342623659836
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	4.027594739811117
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century.	3.7741858332297697
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	2.8529341401747748
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	4.891556377081096
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.	3.0376082212774094
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections.	3.6881995720444505
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6.	3.8375580390946626
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	4.137408706334906
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.	3.126124844681497
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.5033529389158162
Mr President, Mr Fischler, my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues, as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen.	3.6577581035805613
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products.	4.151089935889926
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	3.4875420523372522
We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament ' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.4918290202768736
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.	3.3500004328467985
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.	3.8477950372340737
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	4.961954784303083
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	4.289675622152042
At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.	3.3157190109750543
Its legislation is to apply equally to all, to large and small countries alike.	3.338389750598302
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	2.367505394392421
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law.	2.7861465522920237
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	3.413670599460575
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service.	2.806425600249807
But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels.	3.9323882957046843
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission ' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level.	4.576621526903446
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth.	3.715023943889923
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	3.780880171505908
Mr President, before I came here for today ' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.	3.8921953402565266
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.	3.69383956774557
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view.	4.0785172701380334
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	4.055800788465555
When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost ' and an 'obstacle ' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care.	3.3671638376056072
Mr President, I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture.	3.904294585378552
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	3.8160425519675965
The Commission ' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS, that is to say management companies.	4.092835216484975
This indicates that we have a broad consensus.	8.230094209760685
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.	4.552177818384093
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	3.4778503520313606
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions .	3.5547789799269287
Last year ' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues.	3.4756553040455085
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.	4.011838685211964
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	5.116719233900599
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values.	3.591707012928413
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory.	4.305017145494624
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid.	3.324772327073907
We are all immigrants.	4.658517144733493
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	3.872438420695807
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.	4.211668110634014
To the rapporteur ' s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors ' legal position and impairs their legal protection.	3.5987386607996217
I can perform this dual task.	4.680477113579281
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.	4.475129623329217
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	5.056478214194498
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council ' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament ' s reading of it.	4.092033412405186
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.	4.64679386561401
I am especially grateful for all of this.	4.597844412573315
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.	2.985724322968571
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	2.9153356207769265
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	6.5705488799271246
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?	2.363078363712714
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	4.19567186598653
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.	3.2138981440642325
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission ' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	3.4735081672522465
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste.	2.56947015984875
Mrs van der Laan ' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	4.343212220238311
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.	3.8857265971406147
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.	3.8421702323596314
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening ' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past.	3.614113247715193
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	5.814321806913918
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	3.043183977524575
As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters.	4.321698444902834
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.	3.7317834256038487
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	3.886159616007134
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.	4.942137722238292
On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package.	4.2397439565994866
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	3.9332800556549783
Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content.	4.180923266244441
Our own staff policy is outdated.	3.7707462895743724
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	4.050238232747255
So what do we need to happen immediately?	5.914701583250748
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.	3.072976592977519
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.	4.6601513454031425
Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.	4.193221958129688
My third point has also been mentioned already.	4.335476050622306
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops.	3.8256607988002007
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	4.777533152121878
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.	3.8671561276716058
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless.	4.822921643717965
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged.	3.6916586747652183
Action simply has not been taken.	3.3618119794847
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.	3.2134235949145253
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	3.537229753152335
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel 's relations with its northern neighbours.	3.544133147621985
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.	2.826270520885323
The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	3.9032204820015717
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	3.6952136777594253
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	2.8232405905158044
I am aware of the Member ' s competence on these matters.	4.494721054058815
Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments.	3.4752499060800184
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.	4.183566533755519
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	3.6988983766282457
In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question.	4.162207986455661
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.	4.867824130909958
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.	4.602331333841648
The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions.	6.483348252830711
Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known.	4.740407262681182
Why not?	4.256119963495079
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	3.965469002367793
(SV) This is a very important question.	4.793532542244126
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.	2.5978085565928972
We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe ' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide.	3.6119427134591446
In relation to Mrs Lynne 's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	3.8442535668383684
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	3.5995181767485995
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	5.07934031361827
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	4.363888211596352
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union ' s disputes resolution procedures.	4.055241690930012
In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.	4.0758150952470205
Thank you very much.	1.937494564271333
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.	3.9638375190124737
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union.	3.8101313996791597
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves.	5.693651143982907
They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU ' s population growth.	3.4575492075994463
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.	2.9695536459748304
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	4.86384806878679
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	3.638302234153053
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.	3.2660184128673007
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard.	5.119842289298546
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets.	3.163817439309048
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	5.023926739048609
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber.	5.088898236607078
The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks.	4.924462902262548
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	2.8658272108292735
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	3.7822824366858017
And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.	4.285462961020772
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city.	3.3857157141401566
Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently.	4.391805215679004
Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur ' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget.	4.147537259997658
Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed.	4.157072091961743
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.	4.055871908698451
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	2.0189071833840617
It must be seen to deliver.	4.942779025440103
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.	4.189141334329109
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	3.2163091948860063
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	2.907654766102375
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.	4.748253913821976
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic.	4.413512288799806
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.	3.1461338709490034
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.	3.4869134139696913
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	3.990985333263853
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at.	5.456420373313747
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences.	4.790315710763028
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable.	5.241459844834467
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	6.023946014931286
But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman.	4.43026274422296
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	4.384292320602595
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.	5.061434271846414
The European Public Prosecutor ' s Office is nothing to be afraid of.	4.801264207715465
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.	3.651625082085478
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court.	4.359736786461212
Parliament has no equivalent power.	3.297364061426527
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	3.4764931468714484
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	4.8347246370932
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	3.724350650898499
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	3.832517170066453
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	2.8644384368456883
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	4.773498560902484
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle ' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	4.389816979290142
It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages.	4.041223628598751
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources.	5.38327822527855
Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so.	3.6332780332105803
Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue.	3.0053348650040497
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	4.526309645616637
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	4.667591345839223
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.	3.390537877324151
It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase?	4.179877280965984
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	2.7867076225808183
Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground.	3.4372530519456346
The principle also concerns water charging.	5.1357443200756405
But what have we seen since then?	3.583767813134876
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	3.4661683198285584
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies.	3.50187026048233
However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission.	3.839624826255511
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	3.6799357593695454
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.	3.6363084667248335
These are two of Vice-President Marinho ' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	2.6459573488559007
Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.	3.870431979349847
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this, I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government.	4.506529175306985
The Commission is following with very great concern, as I know all honourable Members will be, the emergency situation in Mozambique.	3.3384005858898638
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.	3.9241892521042723
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	4.928795435043637
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	4.308455517420523
If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective.	4.005212663154275
The ÖVP (Austrian People 's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	3.822164591729413
Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis.	3.4494631179469835
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related.	4.109895004357114
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China.	3.675152688083545
(FR) Drinking, eating, washing, farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it, wrongly, as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource.	2.6003532891989365
The European Union ' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.	3.7736258250215506
Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.	4.61120221907538
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.	3.8189852624093352
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	4.045633518403084
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.	4.29813164321352
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	3.5373456501861713
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.	2.6966195036228715
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.	4.2092265719166235
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.	4.051020952752335
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war.	3.27211781333142
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998.	3.244484318448597
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism.	5.9580737367032635
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.	5.135987126972412
I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses.	4.254953079308755
I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March.	3.9436864782446874
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete.	4.333886430610136
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.	4.28656638005343
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	4.447080680688316
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members.	3.392771020635398
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy.	4.038038411576986
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.	5.243903503688704
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	3.933999080175688
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	3.44388110868365
But we shall have a decision very soon.	4.036174858389421
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa, where violations are viewed as a necessary evil.	3.840815950930779
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing.	4.0006475765744005
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion.	4.072285600593763
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.	3.991346694495557
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure.	3.9478763535067563
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work.	2.3314328081450713
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	3.9774165920632227
Report (A5-0087/1999) by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (COM(1999)148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)	2.4717118796449236
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.	4.7690151475260665
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	4.635257769630718
The environment is in a parlous state.	5.141211368885484
That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success, now and in the future.	4.465509919754214
We expect the Commission to implement it.	4.738886484214696
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider ' s party.	3.981180130433823
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	4.444131520435881
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country.	4.255427600343328
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	4.418157533796279
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour.	3.7950226737707764
The problems in Europe ' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	3.8325109355750446
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	4.485820759817957
Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse.	2.805624951476131
There is a blatant discrepancy here!	3.5364748639893153
We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle.	4.786848780518947
Common fisheries policy	2.1109316325133727
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country ' s statutes to another ' s.	3.428431636211626
We have endeavoured to provide material help.	4.492193989796311
I consider this to be unacceptable.	3.3942247354414286
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission ' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold.	4.353560205122902
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.	4.830842290068669
The second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day ' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island.	4.66024227118548
I do not believe this to be the case. The reason for this decision was, rather, that we wanted to have a special instrument for the Eastern and Central European States which, like Malta and Cyprus, are involved in the accession process, but under different conditions.	4.195183054268681
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.	3.4684310669639236
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values.	3.303732549798365
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	3.170983086741176
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	4.787499700956981
Indeed, it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too.	3.9576438109016503
Whatever the Eurosceptics say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.	3.78554695919778
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	3.0070438980366996
It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties.	4.372480177400507
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
This is no longer tolerable.	2.9943534408868597
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you.	3.680118535893401
Question No 2 by (H-0024/00):	2.9788376251953737
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	4.843733017372127
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council ' s scope for action.	3.74721217906104
Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away.	3.3693919125164333
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.	3.3601268671456777
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.	3.404953900760792
For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission. This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods.	4.095851786250498
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary.	4.129368716908802
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today.	4.169922032807942
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	4.434870151358049
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?	3.489326667481454
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	3.192874528900865
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.	3.4610668934077973
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	3.698092063484108
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	3.593233178284826
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.9838430135809453
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands.	4.974546397276767
It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties.	4.2477946204129555
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	3.8911663070559177
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe.	4.517413310371542
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	4.5764825132035325
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	3.326569506595505
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.	3.847736165100067
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	3.362475438365096
A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of.	4.057720692686745
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	4.492828708516717
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	4.446552399453545
In such cases, there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers, thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy.	4.083576068029728
The European Commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.	4.000055338316074
Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery?	4.283489850165015
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	4.903430442178868
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments, and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which, as debated by the Polish parliament, fill 140 000 sides of paper.	3.4110460884366316
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.	3.4546108488073317
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	2.9870338526444455
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction.	4.53488074766943
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions.	3.064340127090645
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move.	3.3916379466770725
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one ' s own country.	4.319994281080512
That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention.	5.300413221896045
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	4.247172767131135
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council ' s position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible.	4.2583542999496595
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives.	5.0291158105277205
It is important to point this out.	3.5383103167748087
Madam President, I would like to comment on the Florenz report.	2.8415076498506724
. (IT) The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion.	3.660704433711462
However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations.	3.713798608785183
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	4.697398588696037
As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects.	3.7114718307684504
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place.	3.5734820785528196
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States.	3.082611955928476
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union ' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	4.005043164802289
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.	4.199376888376737
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	4.603397456368448
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative ' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.	4.611568426202564
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies.	3.766172202300451
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.	4.41459618861803
Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop.	3.114416092712101
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court.	4.258214367218381
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.	4.106397806935596
In that case, the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity.	4.1229121852021064
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.	4.239698250496507
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	4.159411245435985
National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty.	4.276641063591425
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.	3.162698806078835
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.	5.230137415544887
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.	4.59160417394897
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society.	4.722959638461019
The Food Safety Authority 's situation is quite different.	4.585445543085083
I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.	3.8911897121608323
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	4.4810924427541
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	3.804781514211496
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside.	3.269177458714209
We have all spoken favourably of this programme ' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	4.498260952150051
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.	3.37501409252263
One can quote from the communication.	3.2586094309654334
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources.	3.4273608757186005
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment.	2.9157536813455165
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	3.5785884567021915
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services.	3.4920740393160745
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.	3.540326702047401
I welcome you and your ambition.	5.752532927341284
The present programme ' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow ' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions.	3.966307291931953
I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York.	4.643366672397262
It is not the Portuguese Presidency ' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants, especially those that the European Parliament is asking for.	4.288509375395817
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail.	3.347964137606983
Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.	3.626519993802026
The challenge is to make the system the very best.	6.056216148383556
If the world ' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	4.388499031785823
Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy.	2.3753765962524733
All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.	3.0610387764581453
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on.	5.136001176970168
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it.	3.2770518411116814
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	3.251478637164048
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	4.051512818155331
You are a first class European.	3.6283920464299664
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations.	3.6497879048891577
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory?	4.551869339023567
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	3.779934391300013
This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it.	3.678541477463548
We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity.	3.410371384149097
Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals?	3.951112276287161
Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan.	3.739921018670242
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	3.86012995084869
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13.	3.7934106935373246
I believe that Mrs Theato ' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	4.646010327398796
Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council.	4.19419311610246
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	6.669767628458025
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.	5.35286110230334
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger ' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	4.275857966598276
Thank you for the follow-up question.	3.2470121094105933
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.	4.1200158603641235
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	2.6876941056736223
What is to be done with this money?	6.165760686459571
Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply.	5.00025056047294
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!	3.398832963617392
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed.	3.0704130796303235
He is a dangerous man.	3.579062953278107
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	3.956885385917063
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.	3.0833611640276644
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings.	3.605318055176144
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament 's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	4.824721704063916
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	3.800236315477241
Who is going to pay?	2.947771424964383
But what do these sanctions mean?	4.262945439044778
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	4.667654429598935
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	3.381468496169015
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift.	5.231904113006417
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission 's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	4.088905736432415
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.	4.243322321800118
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.	3.422902560168549
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.	4.0954249517567325
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.	2.9023350909478443
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean.	3.8174021558185998
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business.	3.6022379924254637
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	3.38159663107177
"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."	2.6466391783871344
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	3.966164278815707
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	2.569780209798371
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States.	4.675938264945969
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.	3.82565414052397
In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world.	4.920639568062289
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.078153074093064
On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent.	4.059981584219417
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State, I must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone.	4.32275871631511
However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism.	3.6907394464038763
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.	3.203198244799718
Of course we need to modernise these systems.	3.565778440262781
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.	3.3338492270445195
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	3.518830856727817
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.	4.183208516579309
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion.	3.586282637636898
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	3.1769184211553108
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers ' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.	4.670229249649054
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	3.7748984877072935
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	3.2222157255987147
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.	3.5353153906821957
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	4.025117279553979
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	5.022370626777606
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever.	4.135058489876994
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.	4.602521590554375
Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.	3.5202544509366205
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.	3.9711664297366487
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament ' s position.	5.257504653479569
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy ' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	3.9995038947892363
Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection.	2.5372179175361693
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	4.913986264198455
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government.	4.185958340852739
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.	3.3591616442470835
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	3.1215002181200235
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic ' s forces in Kosovo.	3.6219860798120935
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.	3.6581293447777528
The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union.	4.036185280954793
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	4.966225603003077
Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry.	3.1665912153242446
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	5.19199017620509
I will set this out in five points.	4.857672676467935
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.	3.30998179421945
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.	7.392910621851115
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.	3.0426837638972186
We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns.	4.526439781402004
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People ' s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission.	3.5646632792981663
This debate, I think, has summed it up.	4.025099354562831
I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be.	4.0689609922126975
This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group ' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen.	3.876134081138274
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.	3.670953248210367
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done.	4.625044355704823
And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties.	5.8762158957469675
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	2.7963528941239213
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.	3.2826369976776353
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	4.939180872435235
This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States.	4.20712823661866
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.	4.2380785489638955
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on.	4.497820917776805
Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate.	3.9604475514020945
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	4.5375794705947925
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	4.799459565401338
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3811274786686611
We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument.	4.216863784641868
Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union.	3.5688177083984205
So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission ' s duty.	5.3060467978325105
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities.	4.283820282287668
The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises.	4.2946430306546395
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	3.9392131354294744
Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword.	4.1639455732054795
We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector.	4.275707589950916
However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking.	3.4868849246474993
Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.	2.8599773768852836
My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.888371160615215
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.	4.614923685747945
However, things are really quite different.	4.121282900590774
First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself.	3.9404421826956733
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.	4.346573862954692
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	4.124322319331973
We have taken note of this.	3.2708137685689596
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	4.395588604309258
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes!	4.26128149440517
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	3.568801285829634
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.	3.4563533962159205
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	3.269357818292667
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	3.766792756556138
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	3.8686785133499355
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	3.9209173829936876
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	3.173491114604129
Even in the tourism industry.	4.1386528114341745
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.	3.8453788286969464
Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal.	3.8849758444440523
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer.	4.550295746411171
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.	3.0818120469253487
It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference.	5.654218851981529
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	4.0935274812359035
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	3.808964829184629
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund ' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.	4.565218968539009
But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision.	3.712748137731677
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	4.115768818108417
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.	6.938333682782005
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	3.1893374668901875
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.	4.534702356997063
I cannot accept that.	4.738363599169654
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.	3.9524632247717046
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.	4.462398618112131
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	3.568054883832878
We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words.	5.191665753708432
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one ' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity.	4.349657747535077
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	4.654240887002902
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner ' s answer.	4.56059921556774
That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere.	4.886286598195165
That is transparency.	3.952408514447858
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time.	3.8375649845651627
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	3.6474037332874696
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.	3.868531139235378
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all.	3.242691114996013
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	3.3729763832404807
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.	3.66347504791037
My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development.	4.177441201246673
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	3.2766853960498357
All this is happening on a daily basis.	3.1172936053267084
For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services.	4.197164287745227
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger.	3.293218773819492
Certainly not!	2.5900328632077905
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	4.923390658038659
However, the thing that worries us most, Mr President, is the decrease in prices, by 30%, owing to imports.	3.242664847026499
We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months.	4.245556105483069
One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.	3.6884717528291437
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen.	3.232485237994154
Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.	3.6365720103812715
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	5.330289206140765
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.	3.2290932235538055
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	3.7947679109539436
The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these.	5.366828864992154
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms.	4.565209334164252
At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations.	3.552797526910612
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal ' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion.	4.635793244696813
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments.	6.1918000888671045
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.	3.608425435814056
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.	3.831428443156972
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	3.9873454208305255
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors ' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.	3.644387172047146
Paragraph D points out that "the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils.	4.0898443811878495
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups.	3.0052215103960287
This is not our opinion.	4.518545830743254
. I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers.	5.049061488275614
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.	4.73174247392996
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	3.9234604137935043
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.	2.3966849197846143
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes.	2.649698050793724
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	3.591754890592666
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.	3.5064894632182155
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years.	4.516117847908884
I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land.	3.4910066032224316
These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing.	3.7691113006955965
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.	5.017916603809429
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	3.1316951684952103
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission 's Green Paper on food law was published.	4.630054565758672
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product ' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.	3.9325368942118444
Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures.	4.032843255689006
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	3.919385550741924
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain.	4.22413146346273
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance.	2.993402289558133
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	5.101282527692279
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	3.78929524448785
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.	3.8913882377050633
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people.	4.235978820258127
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	3.7128999389954824
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	3.684962500800944
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas.	4.199245970676305
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed.	3.110417317549763
Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism.	3.0951285285032304
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	3.442941103362713
When we adopt the Minutes for today ' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	3.8562672937422504
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?	3.467344481637722
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come.	4.33957427470709
Of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, while at the same time we deal very robustly with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon.	3.9120900751411196
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?	4.193250298851311
Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland.	4.234163457564235
The Commission ' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	5.3560126625622555
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.	3.5537742393275664
That is my judgement at the moment.	2.795755277860931
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays ' must be applied.	3.194272552890491
Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam.	3.4842943516126517
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	4.128235120288522
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice.	3.656934202722241
Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.	3.4934219319967017
The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic.	5.224372244959652
I believe that is a good thing	6.177102733429907
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today 's agenda.	4.3934545731897074
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.	4.0112827548825
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.	3.0958122628374802
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	4.555864142238155
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council ' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	4.387625977580275
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets, because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably.	3.558605710670404
This must be brought forward.	5.437407269171313
Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public ' s range of savings options.	2.759890410967503
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	3.0689015034958307
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission ' s watchdog.	5.332193785813969
Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission.	4.318326603674202
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation ' s treaties.	3.2985466632801925
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.	4.895713900653901
It is a report which tries to give direction.	3.5667947953839003
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba.	3.5663874690357797
There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree.	3.555502495341741
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force.	3.6099852445392235
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	3.427890780497967
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	3.443438783901426
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.	3.5777731782339823
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.	4.011008281100962
As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry.	2.9874343722410397
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?	2.7667514458838482
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters.	2.64244798332173
Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa ' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures.	3.636829921843054
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks.	3.430558230594925
We should be careful about this.	3.9995118778990073
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	3.6938211953871933
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.	3.4146309861672397
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions.	4.986392746246369
The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough.	3.7028344402697435
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.	4.7009957925764265
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks.	2.05648381364594
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.	3.7240307917482744
The Commission document too, which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon, takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas.	3.7694569227786827
This is a pity, in a sense.	3.6624614926107277
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.	4.583454870181723
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	3.70422172333808
Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months.	3.4926838894894727
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?	2.514740154347489
Cultural diversity is important, and it is under threat.	3.6544907831501443
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	3.8404840487442655
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union ' s regional policy aims.	4.9938801878912775
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	3.9603331693679285
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	3.1908392410534776
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	4.708799144519346
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.7729642561226249
Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front?	4.346386821009917
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	4.150911230802664
This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47.	4.129445130185525
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	4.349565129285846
Mr President, there is a mystery.	4.432590897563848
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade.	3.792338278172044
Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises.	3.38099115968678
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	4.592360651839609
We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.	4.548133628840719
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.	3.93810678437578
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.	3.7299604147061136
In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric.	4.883870484334385
This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe.	4.328954483963008
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	4.3441197914182
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.	4.099958324157012
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.	4.629092943044296
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	3.3895927321069124
In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives.	3.7921536785430967
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.	4.826485013292103
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	3.443726925025916
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU.	3.8443764543593546
Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	3.5652937500148165
Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.	3.647185110656555
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	3.2611987241999256
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	3.463937599712634
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term.	5.13793262349975
Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries.	3.1815215389042475
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	4.215783855839141
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	4.572809934952472
The debate is closed.	1.7896517059311736
Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union.	2.384526234171282
Employment is growing at a good rate.	2.8415026104312657
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.	2.9040210336014707
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	3.6213405327456907
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.	4.266216087886008
Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.	3.2195307729368547
(Loud applause)	1.0387039174734527
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	5.27773814487295
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	3.16170312200271
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	4.175099032867307
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	3.9594642223892884
But I did notice a drop in alertness and when we debated the amendments of our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, you mentioned the Greens on their own in every instance.	3.8602272025764046
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	4.0679302903799766
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?	4.601012841154257
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr Désir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	3.6099949375888314
. (DA) The European project began as a partnership between States.	3.0109666082314774
Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	3.4242742049999344
I remember your predecessor ' s speech five years ago.	4.694659074410315
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	4.376042432962627
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.	2.8937905354058646
You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.	3.7443149906847797
Counterfeiting is not on the list.	2.1924397858287494
What establishes a recognised minority?	3.575605095875334
Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned.	3.5655912713830364
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.	4.109325138619925
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against.	2.722284961894762
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.	3.828550892175631
So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.	4.082884640851594
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	4.285317234790902
We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further.	4.034429471696324
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	3.1305868447368272
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.	3.831551648186116
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.	3.443043421782226
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	3.835817703750396
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	4.0782369672269425
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.	3.0264395069646426
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council ' s functions as a legislative body.	4.83193372000134
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference ' s agenda.	4.5021851942781055
The goal for the years to come is to increase women ' s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants, in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	3.386583193679986
This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate.	3.7628283821896646
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	4.313200825511853
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	5.16130199891716
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	3.81496622459931
They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters.	2.876765854629914
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	2.524675749671589
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	4.377062466431924
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.	4.257576981295711
These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion.	4.473430909809737
The principle of 'polluter pays ' is not being applied.	3.0736653554792586
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.	3.6998759043547196
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s.	3.4249038736919886
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.	3.9841435148572484
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	5.486487156812301
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.	6.199474005502952
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	3.209826513996333
You are most welcome.	3.8623362595480155
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	3.7326284763472137
For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life.	3.7635024291041907
Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance.	5.790035975381724
Still on the subject of Wednesday ' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	3.093716850410013
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.	3.5592007617353145
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.	4.916991177224969
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.	2.809377769736322
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	4.1098181566760426
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	3.595667220509698
Mr Fischler, I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting.	5.010588579745338
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.	3.4526270293102748
A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing.	4.886088522238008
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	5.132440625149923
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.	3.801542276846368
Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work.	3.0508624374288535
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	3.948685387357402
They are very important in this case.	4.01535654882793
Report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999 - C5-0091/1999 and SN 5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809(CNS)	2.3904702897842696
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	4.428829583852831
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal.	4.621581926559064
It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour.	3.653590021995659
The inconsistency is astonishing.	6.100738273348867
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention.	6.0345273646890325
Like honourable Members, I welcome the United States ' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today.	3.347815096038969
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.	4.281091953221669
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.	3.783153018727746
The first is a policy of persuasion.	5.360355128120162
The postal services are important.	4.869512224090735
One can only hope that it succeeds.	4.355966203499724
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women ' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women ' s Day.	3.463965383046369
The declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen.	4.988201379488619
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.	3.558404442240078
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	4.294460527346892
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	4.685570418385509
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding.	4.701724865082999
- (FR) The Commission ' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear.	3.3640072446208724
A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises.	2.4627030836576633
As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.	4.762648987194469
Including Jörg Haider ' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	3.4269420545151204
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available.	6.62397775767292
In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" .	3.5382055460664894
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive.	3.204916266879606
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .	3.4709668571110983
Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered.	4.407451564069714
Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals.	2.2395145980667355
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).	3.8279347503707033
Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned.	3.7687282160943005
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd.	4.450974315819383
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme.	3.9986219782963985
I would urge you to endorse this.	4.12254008041462
There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees.	3.872266277446561
This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia ' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend.	4.706094213844178
Quality products in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies.	4.433843352806091
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy.	3.6135087277413795
The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security.	4.106945409889391
The first concerns women, gender and women 's rights.	3.802449785445316
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods, about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance.	3.390938808961434
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	4.355412470760678
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation.	4.638775554519797
Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.	3.1593491208228013
In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" .	2.8703688006797288
In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments.	4.02457587755459
We have three outstanding problems.	4.84015139566193
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance.	4.744421640239859
But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency.	3.805614568677904
We will talk about this on another day.	3.9159619468772897
I can only fully share your concern.	4.048949424046595
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure.	4.836286020796347
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.	2.8181897440193793
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.	3.977318142165361
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	3.34075653252563
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	3.660894592234038
As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees ' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.	3.3709882146411907
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	4.059332733090304
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.	3.9510403264120657
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	5.044688938086268
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.	4.097037449512531
When six European countries have granted the right to vote, the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote, and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections, to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years.	4.3487495955346125
How have these been organised by Mr Solana ' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?	3.30443379669737
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	4.474693714868099
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors.	3.9873681674637473
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.	4.2414029113731955
The Commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States ' courts.	5.8265575166796255
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement. We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament.	4.473743031293719
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	3.4368072473394875
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.	3.71686667868851
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion.	4.722060838371991
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	4.060541902316442
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	3.500327769364481
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development.	5.435855849097862
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):	2.5649229896829064
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?	3.87941288993574
I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House.	2.8483814081708956
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.	4.00458420647468
They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours.	3.023175999626704
The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself.	3.759159274535194
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.	3.42394403785387
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.	4.5651023819078285
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	3.7471482015268607
Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.	3.663375158104712
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	4.617827624957234
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect.	5.092455765830083
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.	3.5981595568234446
What do they see about the relationships between human beings?	3.447778965278327
Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today.	4.385859999619582
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament ' s assent in two cases.	4.402668411257447
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.	4.0194509247634365
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	3.3662082226828782
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.	1.9239386658356923
Because it is political it is more complex.	2.2802700740059105
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.	3.661738807042304
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council ' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	4.203042256742801
That is just the way things are, however.	3.8663100313968823
That is how the common position has been worded.	4.8594435005758765
With regard to the Côte d ' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities.	4.253641702716114
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.	2.9419496784879358
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases.	4.6351895916696115
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider ' s Freedom Party.	3.045012050400388
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):	2.9437318567393764
With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies.	4.120119668830343
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	3.834337335074658
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	2.512883049678979
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	4.536744300325749
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	3.81155874057148
I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail, Mr President, given the time constraints and also the interpreters ' fees.	4.053961203821815
Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development.	2.760198374204898
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	4.632155778124667
In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe ' s voice is important.	4.027000282787507
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	4.460035851785145
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.	3.7762708222906247
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	4.3645798632930095
I also stressed the need for prevention.	6.77426605823125
Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson.	3.802266317377144
This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.	4.342896180423086
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission ' s intentions.	5.405925564937597
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	4.045607055865659
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	4.174877369117786
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.	4.062948427041952
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	3.6711554944814657
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen, which concerns aid to the steel industry.	4.539357252524502
As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo.	3.3472664174740427
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	4.265694129663779
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.	3.6415341998621855
I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do.	3.834402615773602
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.	4.077748107528671
The main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings, for example units in funds, standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments.	3.7414210826337877
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.	4.5964226381566995
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	4.009395190650591
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	4.18277766389111
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	3.519337636522243
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	3.4293831261989647
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament ' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	4.50246647864559
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.	2.7356066451976204
Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage.	4.453350750763053
We are of the opinion that the Member States ' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	5.147058789182787
No human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today, the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, and in educational institutions, to mention but a few.	3.6335413195125446
We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base.	3.706602393257455
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	2.2630283325538403
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this.	3.718853229338971
Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now.	4.339316989296125
Hence the transmission.	2.510678081070555
It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region.	3.3282779154989517
The other amendments are unacceptable.	5.657466246497611
Is this not a contradiction?	3.7400885590200024
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	4.37014038055857
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.	3.7866738914708082
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.	5.1438770349592575
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	3.2765432002239847
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.	2.9817650480009963
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.	4.91755350084016
The challenges are different.	4.720659984211207
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	3.868349245370082
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.	4.430600836760967
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.	5.70697405102362
This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before.	4.374728698609635
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	3.2991218558095903
It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available.	3.5134651615989205
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector.	5.443697578956338
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage.	5.0695029384641055
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise.	5.2281340118900985
In itself, globalisation is positive.	4.741627591502106
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	3.3597176206396067
On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts.	3.4348786382139362
As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments.	3.8978403842063702
The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission.	5.530165237743739
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	3.8067930904725764
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	4.31927629046331
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission ' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.	3.4792499794999983
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights.	3.170711932622159
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.	5.132856978990708
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	4.917431382345004
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	2.3033672666947647
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?	3.743721846066247
What is the result?	3.3766730562476224
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.	2.875675989483769
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	3.526374718083219
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control.	3.3578064797608844
I am not going to say much more on these issues.	3.454332332446865
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.	4.7262425950465925
Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship.	4.0198112506519585
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	5.131022155370525
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	3.3458867245068906
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	4.083337245533135
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us?	3.7384269055699604
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	4.139976014196064
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	4.284875257083082
In Reunion, for example, the rate is 37%.	6.136232368144864
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	1.8863810877139062
It can only approve Member States ' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	3.5429687276490216
The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles.	4.435567128649378
The same applies to labour market policy.	3.893270919412859
It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament ' s decisions on this subject.	4.615007967029568
And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets.	4.837266530858601
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.	4.81853360833265
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.	3.7417358092176842
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	5.208304644995134
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	3.7042634461322352
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	3.268915176691425
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	3.950641849628899
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	3.3943073566886723
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	3.5558956336984338
It is indeed.	4.936035979802321
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	4.49036379287705
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	3.6718781436577426
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.	3.9946525337597545
As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably.	6.370390721023328
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	3.2417854914751225
The EU ' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector.	4.338944755169967
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	3.609175409046136
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress.	3.4548805563511973
On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4.	2.6282890133085566
Quite the opposite, it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded.	3.9506747616477265
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	3.942540465462851
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China.	3.6122941336549164
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment	1.9855825793336852
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission ' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	3.7632599917155365
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.	3.292359408992249
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	3.3871766708069035
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all.	4.218854355809535
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.	2.8643656521479506
Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities.	3.241279000736139
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	3.410781916099231
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong.	3.415562013830481
LEADER+ should supplement already existing programmes, avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible.	2.867233017912158
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	3.4645975494986745
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	3.6389889198759837
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission ' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.	4.995058417555209
. (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out.	4.274329075603032
I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work.	3.679721628718349
.	1.3940351656188106
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	4.357330898936948
Subject: Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership, involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies, the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding, monitoring and assessment of the measures taken.	3.8961930312183415
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country.	3.5994669988448007
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens ' rights - and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty, combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia, and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence, as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union.	3.7804077364229647
My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.	5.071816732733336
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.	4.138952943852118
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	3.8189393812768815
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	4.124588083006783
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.303714813427912
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.	2.6271392942218883
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	4.328152741015123
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries ' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union ' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.	4.450105081294697
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	4.32751869190477
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000, the date promised by Ehud Barak?	2.338402216658682
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.	3.9756719784164964
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction.	4.2291265366981845
Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go.	3.146967004046607
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative.	5.315258744356225
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation.	4.143399400216789
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	4.01662527680676
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	4.2579375851389285
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	3.4121603383586745
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.	5.2919397628297755
Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	3.9798068498453643
There are many opportunities to hide.	3.366485533568762
If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020.	4.421051708690318
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	3.694837849460849
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	3.5097010294060316
Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.	4.116596472810832
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	3.4909974189336217
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	5.323976181330977
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	3.355542917455372
In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters.	3.6625730465109005
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	4.102076625161568
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.	4.032193837725975
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.	4.337272952956269
.	1.3940351656188106
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.	3.7488887117512593
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	4.95151445709013
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0132/2000) by Mrs Bonino and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the Commission communication on the strategic objectives for the next five years	3.009893414276873
Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets?	4.100385349196181
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	3.0010015068168028
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this.	4.9127372545515104
In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention.	3.605606082918653
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	4.606691747508086
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision.	6.158786756334957
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.	5.554668417423373
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.	3.3576815916898304
-	2.2318028971929302
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.	4.848118416014025
We must therefore act.	4.657256417601393
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this.	3.7291381039724465
It must be known.	3.796620796133748
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	3.5948733848384378
'No freedom for the enemies of freedom ' was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago, the advocates of the revolution which proved, alas, to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes.	2.6528828953866173
The Commission does not have enough staff.	5.599977183746872
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	3.11531129404838
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.	3.4800186715785584
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	4.578603269859401
Genuine transparency of the institutions ' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	4.285282809013243
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	3.4085354527369516
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	3.6551210728984627
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it.	3.2806299986953857
The amendment to the directive on today 's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	3.3691733467189944
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard.	4.188043304119127
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.	4.828553611715791
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.8840611680037562
They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation.	4.319046405302687
The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition.	4.345001619730911
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.	4.515009116793878
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.	4.111058486165578
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	4.5219303511878195
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.	3.998882096315676
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened.	4.1505679766229315
But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy.	5.104366223519485
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	3.7333843813630354
This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings.	4.693956572418972
We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment.	4.6843951671302015
That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.	4.293234678743255
The issue is as topical as it was before.	4.717979219473842
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	3.134972550337185
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	4.119610001795906
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.	5.381330306103274
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	4.6149882981273604
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	4.199253438745823
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	3.2713292745454674
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	3.0420828996199667
Firstly, private investment must be assisted.	4.005541975865616
These are the main reasons for my vote.	2.8820386025108995
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	4.129800356299682
Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment.	3.9818120038301172
Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations.	3.9241043450003525
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities.	3.705734882367868
Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy.	4.337580669043906
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	3.940589061161906
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned.	5.280239416816104
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	5.442682327882433
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	4.5258790178313175
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.	3.8770124818678773
With regard to Parliament 's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.	3.5344699353492204
In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	4.531999319854177
The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data.	4.419621294231956
This argument is therefore not relevant.	5.916996604099831
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.	4.0465661949851075
These are the areas in which changes will be made.	3.0450986732864402
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.	4.58136828581491
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop, at Community level, which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities.	4.616790248898722
Joint resolution on Austria	2.454114661671889
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	4.123780759303956
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.	3.5044336659253466
Negotiations will start no later than 2002.	2.534957071253069
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.	3.921108370458235
This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.	5.527254560633052
Why should this be the case?	3.199735937978423
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner ' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	4.573653910949659
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner.	5.20730282027687
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	2.5833133156508077
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	4.474693922048812
Frassoni Report (A5-0021/2000)	2.206636244200018
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.	4.826677739539153
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	4.401049638313126
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.	4.262847387967657
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.	3.1319293385074904
Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards?	3.0195952004056617
In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation.	3.658032936221483
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	3.872816453258423
At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them.	3.91372240450068
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	3.2275554204038315
Would it be possible for the EU to create a standardised inspection system that would also guarantee payment, out of Community funds, for the inspection of ships that fly a flag of convenience and cannot themselves pay the cost?	3.372998149988132
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	3.3167508290694787
And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago.	3.7351603488561618
So this is what we are going to do.	4.609318913702038
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding.	5.132069503210678
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.	6.318669420192662
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees.	4.308169556701949
I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic ' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen.	4.15948606663581
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question.	4.7232448573586545
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	3.0772471866036324
I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure.	5.541580536315503
Quite simply there is no question of this.	3.3203208178147787
If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this.	4.987446844239844
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry.	3.294523798720825
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency ' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members.	4.8274543602921005
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda ' s work as rapporteur.	3.421246195246385
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	4.0239788367734315
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem.	3.5393312616668937
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union ' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community ' s economic life.	4.060194970278182
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities.	4.000683674138944
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.	4.737563252106816
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	3.741494277633967
By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000" are superb.	4.195355247115483
The Commission 's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.	4.53110890263093
These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us.	5.4485795903233125
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.	4.8805767486870835
With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality, as you know, this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.888427214785789
.	1.3940351656188106
Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings.	3.7372708340653777
So I believe that we should take today ' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.	4.644537344297861
We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.	3.7152094973758096
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.	2.9162034407584776
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors.	4.4957468251708645
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf ' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report.	4.838584532529333
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House ' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.	4.600507453599908
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies.	4.297537831959655
Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.7683966355589518
I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.	4.309395892866012
Parliament has amended the contractual text.	2.8597457031571536
Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment.	4.304723664940084
Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.	2.7982337098281427
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.	3.3617702745324474
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors.	5.006019297653878
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	4.770781077493803
Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve.	4.458978563743245
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	2.9658425153677848
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened.	3.7150087399907856
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	3.7819774768898857
Madam President, with apologies to my friend, Enrique Barón Crespo, I should like to speak against this proposal.	3.5210425965340604
In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security.	3.8563874563150633
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	2.8331597591828865
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	3.7777933367503898
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.	4.003739096064882
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.	4.490246005848448
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.	3.945998306350839
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	3.7707003558027417
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe ' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	4.834665760987673
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.	2.9968520533804237
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission 's position on the report.	5.553083199672214
For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion.	3.8105073639077554
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	4.01191117919612
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.	4.159274323180334
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.	3.219580773157538
I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.	3.8643496799531816
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question.	3.6222116467113827
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	2.570901454726757
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	3.880364994031267
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects.	3.722217625165848
We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members.	4.137145243233513
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	4.086177980065222
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	4.032966470003767
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	3.933152265593612
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	3.9624595718255016
Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers.	3.175531969930164
. (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE.	6.020920804645462
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations.	4.585045821020233
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account?	4.210864051137291
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	5.348109579988424
As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish.	3.4557614687923706
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva.	4.607597074376076
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers.	2.612721597353161
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.	4.947643899020886
We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe ' s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.	4.633141663923864
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	4.261001524131748
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	4.164010513037464
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	4.448614235922547
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.6015314045278135
I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi 's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy.	4.623889034597067
This is something to which we all want to contribute.	5.209056836617165
These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection.	5.479799992166552
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	2.777379384813621
Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta.	2.842350799875529
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State.	4.499993320617026
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse.	4.034860436189504
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	3.0897076063415914
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	4.961282161459795
Report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/2000 - 1999/0240(CNS)	1.7993213144282665
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	3.5139525776008558
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3).	3.906561592257756
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	4.172137938598529
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers ' main claims towards the highest common denominator.	2.9918441906197235
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.	3.8066376041451138
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	3.955964584798391
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.	4.615822395108567
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail.	4.386761780632453
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	3.7085630114122874
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.	3.7291400761854536
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.	5.303597601685834
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?	2.779164532959034
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	4.109246510920083
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	4.07937730976409
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	4.004880266596638
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	3.199780090639702
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation.	4.6026641402313855
Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries.	4.811715810333667
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.	2.951878304922585
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries.	4.266694490218041
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider ' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	3.3496016362673355
While others may have the biggest rockets, the EU has the deepest pockets.	3.749138957437815
In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights.	4.438212375822999
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace.	4.930088417167238
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks.	3.4233244358737918
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	2.777618794485586
Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes.	3.3200742520779296
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	4.623895517391721
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.	2.687623136163609
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	3.70713749354126
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture ' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	3.591133439703813
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.	4.777702323631384
Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro?	4.6013021952549416
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	4.457351433237223
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	3.7833792280011926
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	4.894870745732017
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.	4.243962872001929
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.	3.638515513030116
Bankruptcy procedures	2.047382164318938
But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh.	2.8812890797339095
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.	3.550598782084236
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	3.5294425420397992
On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion.	4.232724216505683
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.	3.4382732732962586
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology.	5.315517077300027
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	5.6977489694433245
Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier.	2.5097280169836433
The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact.	4.281012246888371
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years.	3.275043749171683
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening.	5.7616447899660015
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.	3.8937810002065656
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!	1.9911907168564769
The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.	3.2315764803087252
This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.381344164360245
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.	4.255971068656892
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	5.283501038560425
I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens ' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union.	4.051043850973108
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests.	4.6591969449716135
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	3.7518301991824208
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.	3.5907134490338772
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	3.613863467105128
We must take the best from each of our countries.	5.4903784674678535
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	4.299652779591573
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	3.9343181266521254
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement.	6.100694758348819
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.	3.4219896221896446
The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99.	4.024697830335009
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:	2.4784405780513956
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities.	4.270455971429483
In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office.	3.8181394566997104
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	3.2411396749177634
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	4.176296178232383
But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?	3.163343590485742
These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period.	3.0869206626540557
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State.	3.5427591417568474
The first key concern is independence.	4.838776681357627
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	3.456277935527418
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.	3.896745999792773
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	4.317198760606874
The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia.	3.865921254239527
In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers ' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	3.7386003074025305
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	2.5757653517393533
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People ' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	3.0821973339531303
Nothing could be further from the truth!	3.043777825093534
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.6408668802820534
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	4.177179245478286
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	5.306831029876808
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	3.665055845671489
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council ' s wordings are the best.	4.033692679998619
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	3.7934778451309987
We want more than that, however.	4.979637321069558
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.	4.031844014518797
This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes.	3.872047130536252
Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment.	3.0403300061903735
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	3.916808531664111
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.	3.2618682811838005
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.	4.930163081917194
Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann ' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur ' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity.	4.302365773502617
The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone, is not workable.	4.238943230096363
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	3.0780893596674335
That is something we would do well to recognise.	3.419303365208779
The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance.	3.4444727729299776
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.	4.153833503420967
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	4.490423008986713
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency.	5.077379571200794
Mr President, Mr Katiforis ' s report is exciting.	3.2538807418602556
Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on.	4.193395257987258
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.	5.39988436547886
In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements.	5.087897076745491
(SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson ' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	2.6177990043468213
It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds.	4.440278667003786
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.	4.489583662943433
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.	4.030221738903725
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.	4.068113539670793
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.	3.966009883057997
I also hope that, if there is any life in outer space, as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn, it was tuned in to Mr Havel ' s speech as well.	3.972463543574177
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	7.030593170256212
At the moment, the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem.	3.5327722362161578
This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species, such as tuna in this case.	3.48956555790774
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.	4.608359477401961
We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies.	3.688422138655328
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	2.9354036695861194
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	4.043145371084554
Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society.	4.590009839435847
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.	2.897834413949501
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	4.262459053917788
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays.	4.450844139233554
In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places.	4.186485185458719
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	3.204819473179632
What is the role of the scientific committees?	4.858733674447764
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.	4.866650662582099
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	4.487685944004328
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.	3.4240737690403056
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.	3.8924368354421452
I agree completely.	6.525555260868068
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	3.8067237917752
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.	4.5077569860177515
For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU ' s institutions respond to our citizens ' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection.	3.8094777158679958
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals.	3.395478598749729
So a great deal has to be done in this area.	5.745304926363529
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.	4.5143628417167285
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights.	3.573694999226543
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.	3.8558658904578076
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women ' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.	4.813893043765061
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	3.9670531731490333
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	1.8776503672855824
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument.	4.178831587680382
Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road.	2.5694949672794833
Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements.	3.9245234024377544
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested.	4.775064853211501
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.	4.2988143280746005
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	3.1309443307552045
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history.	4.116983478188188
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to.	3.246276973976984
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika ' s owners?	4.033045709201535
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe.	4.620865096196941
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.	4.584107823355379
Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency.	3.5187466938383425
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.	3.6249586445120867
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.	3.289678109371727
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	4.5258856590456675
The Commission ' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.	4.306026826229839
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	4.592679708529834
I refer to Eurodac.	5.028859681569647
Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under.	4.3222001906125715
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	4.320428870587754
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	3.633141656558303
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.	4.4936961607643555
We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	3.7967318485343498
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	3.450920597265608
Finland ' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	2.723636763913399
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.	5.836976098800344
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	3.8892417458238464
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	2.71080225797628
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland.	3.9136134229753283
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.	5.0230769806053805
Declarations of principle are not enough.	1.7938676152515762
I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85.	3.84659277159752
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	5.895490037396909
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random.	3.7082480559019304
(Parliament gave its assent) President.	2.2147574706146598
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.9357803128577786
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.	4.070342524017844
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	4.787928895749247
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner ' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	3.2973768949632096
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.	3.9107166059262246
Coordination is the key word here.	3.0479240812020056
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	4.203570671074826
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.	4.482981530156084
And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action.	3.46930310470917
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	2.4355857137704033
This is an unwise policy.	4.003933344193011
We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable.	4.145154017603499
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.	3.2934438176556977
Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman ' s right to vote, should be linked to the women ' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women ' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.	3.6791969943179788
In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.	3.5734838869142935
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card" and not "EU service provision card" .	3.4431248207562164
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.	4.390436720066498
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	3.23103748160485
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.	5.906790801133935
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised.	4.503885203122254
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	4.188368746855978
Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those.	3.5179421866178484
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems.	4.999985243132556
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future.	4.864362987583104
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test.	4.9161708817619525
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	4.219005638089697
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	4.2236550038117295
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	4.193654173996887
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement.	3.968684536413321
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	3.735546198750663
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	3.0459146683660516
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	3.7615971909471444
Mr President, I see two problems with this morning ' s debate.	3.0361535248093965
That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic.	4.0521594044996245
At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity.	3.53558651046581
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.	2.784538466667387
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.	2.3592717624459794
I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law.	3.957667747770241
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.	4.979581639188441
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers.	4.812510351812347
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges, in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.	3.82448178689183
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.	4.669418434299183
What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?	3.064005123988449
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership, even under cover of environmental protection.	3.2756011277852766
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	3.457682592618659
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people.	4.627401268726422
Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on?	3.462365588867701
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.	3.935365961140295
Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on.	3.0227258471288603
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.	2.458231734185223
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.	3.060258361564391
Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies.	3.532620797273831
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	3.8411649710400253
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.	3.449053133932546
It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there.	3.584615907499761
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	3.1747211277002574
Parliament supports this.	3.6657944911409945
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	2.466515406097203
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.	3.097592684610044
Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy ' even more degraded social provisions.	2.968970347922861
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	4.324869074492743
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.	3.192615436482909
We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action.	3.3325567803513017
As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described.	3.7170041402253595
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	5.613606524269999
I am convinced that the rapporteur ' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament.	3.9651834368280348
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union ' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	4.1051911950962126
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	4.02867253008651
When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs.	3.239630168385873
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows.	4.324260399560869
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period.	4.98300054450823
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2171741186138525
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	5.14691532470909
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.	4.5546729345158
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.	3.5883470586779076
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives.	2.846558388675834
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.	4.040155213156893
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	4.357393753481375
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	4.186154194871322
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	4.069470728094921
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.	4.087988765398957
What we need here is good government, Madam President.	2.531177164579309
Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission ' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period?	3.7836428570748386
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.	3.159457574145794
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	4.546868639731716
Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important.	4.889418306102078
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal.	3.7647343684848527
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.8005890760472703
We will also pass this on to our services, however.	4.02655121129391
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.	5.420464022588875
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	3.655402601941847
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies.	4.28955951884994
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	4.194036197060479
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	3.5539189885576143
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	5.566191156531515
The Council ' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law.	4.37704993860419
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	5.780951671141676
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	4.598414383681752
However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle.	3.3814137323117084
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	3.3573804953809905
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.	3.9415450771716367
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.	4.332275305608678
No, you have not done so.	3.8823051126691217
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.	3.7667271040730816
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	3.7595899013831473
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government.	3.9203726414873423
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.	3.802206075303547
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person ' s ethnic origin.	2.9121176929541672
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	1.6621124568602526
The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations.	3.8790473181465615
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE.	4.070603432416178
If you ratify .	3.9117271440799977
I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks.	4.687259429937427
I accept that Mr Andersson 's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU.	3.801466583200731
Question Time (Council)	2.045435526911663
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe.	5.078125810304108
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.	3.2054621898397313
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	4.040539285673025
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.	4.484161561926729
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	3.8964190410073765
However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers.	4.547573749505423
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations.	4.155354952296754
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems.	3.9561146008010932
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.	3.0815685168495364
Our objective, the committee ' s objective, the Court of Auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	4.000917186502684
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	4.117189821233898
Thirdly, because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals.	3.5983224923315107
This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.	4.475670244700594
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	4.344179321154828
Because they have fewer opportunities.	2.476624287734221
.	1.3940351656188106
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site.	3.4561024098594535
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	3.6914373227418418
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation.	4.531156794901493
In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position.	4.962715229566733
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.	3.488454598597464
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	4.085290915220203
The Court 's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	5.4984235755443445
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	4.008802083554683
Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse.	3.7079573689893404
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.	3.7913299068046156
.	1.3940351656188106
My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe '.	3.390075325341305
Some of these parties, despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic, adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right, either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy, if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment, and generally making their lives more difficult.	2.8554026514975472
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.	4.142525542579674
Mr Corbett set out Parliament ' s concerns.	5.0050382806598535
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	4.226418579182638
The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998.	4.105268592649041
I do not have exact figures, but the Community ' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.	4.0221605543519825
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city.	3.4045559678617825
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States.	3.4199566465500633
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	2.4023015464702913
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	4.511606677117222
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	4.272088207178385
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?	3.193773059406864
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	3.414061447976542
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women ' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today ' s debate.	3.5461286036982216
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	3.9044294931042853
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.	3.502006493248075
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.	4.025910572283673
Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children.	3.5872270604479786
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	4.502628490743969
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur.	6.170007181004564
Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.	3.743318092490637
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	3.764371600621112
What about women?	4.605513633467049
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.	3.9518907714523954
Mr President, peace is the European Union ' s very raison d ' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	4.176543314762903
In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies, so that it could form an opinion, and asked the European confederations of hotel-and-restaurant owners and tourist agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them.	3.4649690217628746
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered.	3.4504377496249052
The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.	3.7575001468178
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	4.181516559055324
I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.	3.811614418944854
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	2.823666081873765
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.	4.074089804283706
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?	4.287903591961478
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	3.9038693640241973
The Union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.	5.516575263671466
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.	4.471729726117108
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2472483132960324
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.	4.300349154790902
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	4.799742816253933
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision.	3.9975873101748705
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	3.4403517532107024
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.	4.727860746305756
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.	4.269614568854907
However, the aid needed now is difficult to get through, despite the efforts of the NGOs, because the roads, bridges and railway lines are damaged.	3.487740568326
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts.	5.211488138749455
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	4.748265169968343
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions.	3.92534645895742
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.	6.39415495392705
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission ' s communication is ill-considered.	3.4609656732053677
On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law ' and 'wilful murder '.	3.386547336065039
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.	4.548256152533914
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	2.8936111184989817
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States ' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	4.610162555136186
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.	4.105554302482931
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	4.3477376245923205
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy.	4.609818840139612
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed.	5.556848905558818
We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen.	3.7267696843707316
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission ' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.	4.247697518386356
That message must be taken back from here today.	4.759643157861122
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	2.473224173631534
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	3.3935370571392904
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth ' s sake.	4.522833696442264
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	3.1922363157051863
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO.	3.713999463200212
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.	4.241589136289991
Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles.	3.3010172583112896
The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road.	3.9775672658905172
I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50% self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information, that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk.	4.610752834678284
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.	4.545507295374103
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration.	3.378031237495667
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up?	4.071942896222007
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	4.233290638800932
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	4.521731927403718
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves.	4.128285190732713
It has clear, ambitious objectives.	4.517596120690976
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary" activities.	4.096143154402462
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.	4.720841303958709
It is thanks, too, to Parliament ' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens ' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale.	4.589520196033075
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	4.272566028641839
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory?	3.2934880190833775
We Socialists reject the liberals ' naïve optimism on this point.	3.344481145527772
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	4.245753431035786
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee)	4.38034241456482
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.	4.529661767045048
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.	3.5930872516378685
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	3.8125012817963033
On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last.	4.348604105438827
Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe,	4.730576124983245
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.	4.8324640698442884
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.	4.266355503983545
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	2.7917240121003664
For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid.	6.299912166841135
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	3.1761799641949082
In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities.	5.618451442705343
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament ' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.	4.4659661106484165
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today 's session.	5.008180878671652
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.	3.72315173095243
The Commission ' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence.	3.8154417692155405
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn?	3.831882925974479
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.	3.245067472296468
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 100, can economically compete within this very challenging environment.	4.516030137851201
Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	3.7984379459971205
I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.	4.5306150987906975
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	3.8803000888679158
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	3.7156387948013747
All the foreign troops, including therefore the Syrian forces, must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council.	3.084657706974011
Since 1993 the Commission 's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	3.57045944880662
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety.	4.43226098123853
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	4.269720739795588
My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue ' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities.	3.7983779999848712
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.	4.83326140326319
As important is the fact that Austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	4.946091085995198
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	3.8296443364772164
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	3.586346607249892
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident.	2.3208545170536405
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	2.567057134871831
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	3.8974135780240915
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.	2.869467788167311
End-of-life vehicles	2.100435507077672
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments.	3.414243158522272
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	4.562540874222853
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	2.491325659071533
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	3.931530558315554
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	4.449595140296271
In other words, our rapporteur is proposing an oral amendment to add a recital reading: 'Whereas Malta and Cyprus will participate. '	3.371913542300217
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	5.591992732375228
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	3.204808096967418
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.	4.650278937904457
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	5.578493642935159
The directive remains in place.	4.573843407662931
Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky.	3.2414392071516374
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.	4.02736794775678
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	3.5528646057731175
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.	3.9109440114790535
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	5.096237621376648
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings.	3.7401348517823467
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report.	4.572014179090486
This is the citizen of a state ' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	4.384354570973156
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2665581116050673
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	2.2107160513153943
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.	3.3775840299633924
And what exactly should be done?	3.401997423835044
(Parliament approved the joint text)	1.5688564067660473
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.	3.4567437122984117
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community 's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	3.9658853965532526
I have already appeared before the French Senate.	4.565956131325469
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	6.21931596552442
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	2.9060351091638017
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East.	3.0492812339275535
If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.	4.309067183556805
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky ' s life and freedom.	3.2484956275857955
. (PT) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals.	4.080961055155981
On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition.	4.5455793159445
European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used.	2.973644209078155
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.	3.962226978683833
Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities.	3.3675616511992628
In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences!	3.214162400641686
In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	3.158662722169654
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.	3.9378580940603896
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.	4.317087309421536
In this it said that in a few years ' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	4.637968515142414
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	3.8918372503573786
Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council.	4.317851621178441
Furthermore, I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, that is to say the Office in Alicante, to comment further on this new question and I can, as a result, inform the honourable Member as follows, on behalf of the Office:	3.8895426166655933
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.	3.8621457628750475
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough.	4.410328367554912
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	3.9946613306088032
I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support.	4.156258750932432
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	3.50211881498474
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.461642231690941
Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment?	4.499013786595515
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	4.961796372639866
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.	3.8494284947059856
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	3.094936779677541
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.	3.3852180428784266
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.	3.310625515025441
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive.	5.083061160834442
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	5.9002053377511405
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	4.235458211795691
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries.	4.521172121701509
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.	4.097880168086004
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.	3.353262267947208
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.	3.3973768794582666
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	3.702330783007156
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.	3.7572455528164697
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	3.9982812358538116
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.	3.1520154582983255
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.	4.651187342954318
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	4.887714540433715
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	3.4636285947319805
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.	2.9486563122673752
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming.	4.825848563308264
Over the past couple of years, a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and, more especially, the Lomé countries.	3.5328611506765997
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	3.5699677002766883
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised.	3.9071302464138697
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions.	4.864202046643363
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.	3.7359328817856454
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.	3.97815592110959
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	3.4445752861060175
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force ' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.	3.6062451411622134
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	3.609672090525914
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	4.79275564032455
(FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation.	3.0626707060820606
Women and children were beaten.	3.3997489098790004
Parliament voted in favour of this text.	4.5879616304159665
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.	3.40582274490139
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.	3.3442338792942645
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission 's proposals.	6.5988942595318205
I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	5.309675386021934
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	4.4718052950542715
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	3.873548998747518
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	4.327820031820117
If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development.	4.3907814418371185
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24	2.3885247719967966
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them.	3.0047730377119586
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	4.249782789469807
In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans.	3.7904732430766983
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	3.7055169553135596
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time.	4.190951530556869
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting.	2.5500127515719546
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	3.5746979070998366
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.	3.397626074821593
That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place.	3.880953516695585
Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights.	4.31135334366104
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council.	3.226486651872896
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate.	3.65206064083625
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	3.632927574843893
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now.	4.411008984702067
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.	4.390902037353766
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.	4.483396550098127
So we must practise selective fishing.	3.075366157329473
I have therefore asked the European Commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at conserving and protecting resources. This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions.	3.968598953425572
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	3.5903244261992926
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.	3.1998267866656986
The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.	4.24318356807935
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.	3.364582935719463
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	2.5524009161725623
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.	4.219420317449649
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations.	4.343208084479809
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	3.704883493101125
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	4.229889960148775
Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	4.181908086489527
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.	3.8436043714007995
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	3.8989485146846596
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears.	3.5706577733586276
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.	4.51818081185605
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.	3.2808562038480895
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	3.005431319043372
The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the "statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues, 13-14 March in Bergen" (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS).	3.4416165962949044
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	3.4266973898489894
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens ' rights and judicial cooperation.	3.7594951159672
As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept.	3.6773363833552737
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	2.60691041422087
In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences.	4.5459035397655345
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement.	4.608443476720565
This is why we are abstaining.	3.9037271936522546
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	2.734309900408977
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	3.3021885479008906
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	3.2247753250617435
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.	3.0439029538075677
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe.	4.039646413193654
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	4.204910925530933
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	3.960720859238727
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	4.8562405798061254
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	3.3581764216176113
Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level.	5.3023115192815995
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime.	4.691695201497226
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	3.062909323732934
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	3.6951790500429853
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.	4.032878504530555
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	4.936316895684085
What are we doing about it?	2.9689097003317655
Mr Alavanos, I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited.	5.053923427120536
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.	3.2280832893890152
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	3.423980492048238
Moreover, these are factors which create employment.	3.558877979083406
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	2.581778186153826
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	1.9094601417476402
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial.	3.3447436201897625
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	3.256371686921112
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	4.215059330091455
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	3.8822724521407763
We want to talk about coherence.	4.398310968416727
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here.	4.334138620997561
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000 ' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	4.105007226784318
So that is the world as it is today.	4.991506400534388
On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States.	2.864525374451854
I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community.	4.69292979471902
This is an arduous task.	4.114659941852284
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	3.5512111940889115
In this light, I think that the European Parliament ' s role will be limited in Lisbon, but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation, but are unsure as to the input we can have.	4.507223680585548
The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future.	3.803362692917716
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known.	3.27875949835333
We think they should.	5.710254876105455
Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle.	4.078865854618085
We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security.	4.250492679709409
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame.	4.115589005523648
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	2.72884551214274
I welcome Parliament 's support for that.	4.47496660682435
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.	3.7611583403013937
Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer?	2.881254289131582
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur ' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	4.058986250653063
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.	4.1586400200650315
We all know the picture.	4.236701416716112
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.	3.652052863094595
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	3.376494841342589
Scrapie	2.601756410320264
However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle.	4.497634556328159
Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic.	3.4358201225970606
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	3.871378516432063
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	4.251351272022249
We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character.	3.07514942443205
However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.	4.65935438556252
We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group.	3.5380133174313326
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	5.133960059858558
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	5.414655310535259
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.	3.785755252102934
But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland.	3.647568512942655
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.	3.9670950985504234
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe?	3.346835851255467
This is all I can say today.	4.028454110652192
Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together, and of course, it leads to peace and understanding.	4.275292107369017
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people ' s access to the workplace.	3.5757595220510305
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities.	3.298979363938413
Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable.	4.452906307745536
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe ' s citizens.	5.3989235081963605
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament ' s credibility.	4.2563963903558015
Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.	3.92810128419911
I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries.	4.761023266777106
With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then.	3.3973450202617363
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure.	6.0791990375422476
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	3.334360281606082
That is what Culture 2000 is about.	2.637548676278253
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999.	4.559629191341658
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million.	3.1597706059116293
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity.	3.932535025017032
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.	3.047384273490713
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.	4.598952098351197
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.	5.8112176508400575
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	2.7161840616663038
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.	5.206833787052259
This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.	4.400857499120005
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	4.256956447742169
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.	3.0698079287994338
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten 's report.	3.235628649790585
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive.	3.541433786006372
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	4.279130874477533
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	3.409043511129688
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	4.0378342792544535
Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report.	4.199495167644457
Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities.	2.822600882685333
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules.	4.96351934438653
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries.	3.995553414023029
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	5.182152848047497
The first question, then, is about who should pay.	4.441045514597913
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	4.992568912669005
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework.	5.874402685564385
Natural habitats were destroyed.	1.8697454881832571
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process.	3.685680851289242
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	3.7678088055109287
Nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14, which is contrary to the Commission ' s right of initiative.	3.4812095165209374
The government of the United States, or of Israel?	6.980514657079855
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.	3.951067209981946
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	3.6300334906506593
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event.	3.7295484567405808
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.	4.482967310560646
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	4.731202605050245
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	3.4080649428184713
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive.	3.764097781766367
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes.	4.224215191045229
What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.	4.830631017121044
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):	2.8058119602112006
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe.	3.9614650910455143
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	5.012288380107626
Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti.	3.8665577136349594
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.	3.129937058023659
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.	4.488779630003072
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people.	3.4573195887510435
Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.	3.637049277465466
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	4.985485859024174
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	4.535586686512369
However, more work is needed on this.	3.653707416976853
I want to underline that point.	4.215715480105267
In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.	4.671098158500679
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties.	3.787634948461875
One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions.	3.4362661713420826
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	3.24390769600116
In addition, this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital, which is one of the central tenets of the internal market.	4.137163079711865
It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now.	4.352457090026151
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	4.135330355676747
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	3.3869998984054943
We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet.	3.210843679231762
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	3.1240353477248943
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.	4.494809442674654
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	5.231447154127404
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	4.671070510592055
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	4.443109865880743
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	4.59632773130091
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.	3.5897314872477986
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.	4.389877318241676
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.	3.9674259411431745
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	5.265897301551746
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.	3.8447402915428524
Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement.	3.604786486147117
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.	4.024043463578019
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved.	3.327310131583226
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	3.732378525270117
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.	4.0107765175098855
Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be .	4.042215361249323
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments?	3.9771373266533505
That concludes the debate.	1.9556947861217602
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.	6.036201005581347
It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments.	4.385966046410888
Well in simple economic terms, Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity.	3.149409320838916
In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step.	3.676338537025979
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.	4.1625475075283145
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	2.898651045153409
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Böge ' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament ' s temporary BSE Committee.	4.034302463404352
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council.	3.4841301060738235
Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.	2.4251750271112673
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas.	3.578040397934402
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU ' s Barcelona process.	4.077444012284805
Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted.	3.923158414056402
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.	5.094907354672832
It will be voting against it.	4.093048740802068
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters.	3.1137387909260807
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region.	4.521277277874793
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission 's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	4.775539300128413
Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration.	3.8815326353591093
First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	3.7639432711359664
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	5.363173372504996
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions.	4.1901160448966275
We must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the AIDS disease are fully met. These countries include Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.	5.068041667635632
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?	3.541214621529489
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt ' s report brings us.	5.455851102051334
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	3.1038818930121908
I share the Commission ' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	3.9896513007110084
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.	4.02784314701471
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.	4.316414184471978
By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years.	4.432773375553422
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment.	3.75067230858539
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament ' s credibility on environmental issues.	3.9558254808026247
They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas.	3.088704579736488
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	4.751006222148088
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.	4.578237711676213
Let us be honest.	3.4586944890854703
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.	4.039056614089523
The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.	3.7156294383874844
These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain.	3.522492710054835
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	3.8744938782362324
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	3.504945650843808
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?	3.871233498644199
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	4.3307777282433015
This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme.	3.5173146943612785
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union.	4.116345910940761
In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach.	3.7150162532973714
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	4.106921220156742
Jörg Haider ' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth.	2.875653080855607
But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated.	4.544167095797331
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.	3.9145513899584787
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.	3.231679286527852
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us.	5.581486919075589
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?	2.77616777517696
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not.	5.450041349529375
In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States ' national authorities.	4.43804744314403
In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice.	3.9591157031215745
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	3.764138768951675
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission ' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.	4.742811368248086
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council.	4.7101282659409724
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	4.213120751903048
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.	3.5893541119122463
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless.	3.6313776936569986
We need to match this vision with reality.	3.337177490036831
I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	5.296033325145225
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	4.776658072203303
Supposed draft environmental directive: "European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain, during winter, a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and parks of the cities of Europe ".	2.7964201704554847
We need to change tack completely.	3.8530246769549006
After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation.	3.3199251921994133
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	3.155837769452321
This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.	4.221843628668336
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised.	3.8685224352722494
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	4.6264979145137985
We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again.	4.584397384571583
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.	3.9076229463709686
The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy.	4.4044193510213665
Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence.	4.632966599155467
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone ' s reach in society.	2.8961051216189095
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	3.228361479065381
.	1.3940351656188106
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	4.0902824321241935
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.	4.547590860134106
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting.	5.671542661971996
As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency.	3.7099519694467973
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	3.5530027720143114
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.	5.391963728541953
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake.	4.0712333942187815
Firstly he talked about verification.	2.8505440500039905
Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries.	3.6199189678537143
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.	6.305506308875456
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening.	3.6434700790956605
They see us restricting each other 's liberties.	3.193476389747524
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source.	3.135224821505244
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	3.8795032707565826
I can show you a copy if you wish.	4.168566035907631
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	4.197418150531517
The European Council in Helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which, as I said at the beginning of my first speech, represent a window of opportunity.	4.070510682648327
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	3.085499674482833
After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International.	2.890651535775304
Despite these objections of mine to the Council ' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.	4.127224801329897
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.	2.3350375486491273
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.	4.0289508665766505
It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies.	4.636803271355292
And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to "refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention" .	3.3165165171419497
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission ' s support programmes.	4.360405131671349
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	3.682991947283611
People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved.	3.332520883567191
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	1.9451468837011094
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally, and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome, so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme.	4.959986162046056
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.	3.029351786637473
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission ' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives.	5.434130694516443
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.	3.471276684800498
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	3.850595592079765
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.	3.7833071614138154
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.	5.660856872944164
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences.	4.617960334561982
Mr Rübig has the floor.	4.663770250461427
Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation.	4.640909229212742
Clare Short, MP, is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and, as such, can take her case to the very heart of government.	3.608203136384334
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.	3.5011592753818213
Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive.	3.929554837849863
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.	4.007334448797853
I would, however, like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date.	4.588649677387307
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	6.639494780679463
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	3.2544306598028725
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs.	4.777684132415921
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission ' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.	3.489295157083832
Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements.	3.4071567141536794
As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities.	3.4615788040875404
The two processes are separate processes.	4.769343029818353
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation.	3.00125719397277
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.	3.8479528414136226
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	3.9316192413316
There is no contradiction between the two.	2.347662999808249
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?	4.511990091162616
I must highlight the part of the report which states that, in 1975, with regard to the size of bluefin tuna, a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15% tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic.	4.43419769672858
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	3.5333966138884514
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.	3.825917304900236
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.	3.822840567824321
I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself.	4.174115004643643
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission 's work programme for 2000.	5.070190833092045
These cases keep occurring.	4.421769214978685
Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance, reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do.	4.931873758701193
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation.	4.686463767061301
Do not take too long to send it back.	3.0834677583172576
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice?	4.358258305316207
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports.	3.441406959315305
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union.	3.711200167649148
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.	4.545999284426613
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking?	3.0728042546013414
As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future.	3.606971655986096
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow.	4.665135531388473
I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped, in line with the Commission ' s proposal.	3.429262586679013
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	4.4844990650443535
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts.	3.9212001816870177
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	4.702115800180664
The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial.	3.617441114541724
VOTE (continuation)	2.953215076923021
First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative.	5.541602961496107
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	3.993600791557155
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.	3.6403471308042232
Madam President, coinciding with this year ' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.	3.2571986422889556
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	4.366871191931553
Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union.	4.224567478946052
How would you describe this?	3.7066674095394605
It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!	3.5730661629367066
As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis.	4.538258640366586
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.	5.447082339351406
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.	3.392869817390587
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.	3.9449469340077323
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	5.605857060807668
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission ' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	3.4356537978244686
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank.	5.251906650701664
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny.	4.882024578026718
The results are certainly not what we expected.	5.399923670526372
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	6.137223939751901
I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average.	3.403145533746782
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.	3.874173900015857
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	3.7196389277096773
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	4.205318359270323
On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party.	3.0607834833958187
As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation.	3.5190616636518626
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.	3.9681519615334766
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.	4.091396660044296
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	3.5642537755429258
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	4.730822070673274
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	4.238573441618938
Why?	1.994122001244139
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint.	4.178351561139538
A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year, may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years.	4.259603795973651
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue.	4.770299939603636
As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago.	3.2415220776450577
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.	5.49931360023963
Now I believe, Commissioner, this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament ' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken, otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past.	4.096152963766245
Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.	3.055783828178786
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security.	3.6191428126765124
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	4.169542873375662
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	4.261464451754376
On this we are clear.	3.8135379523732764
That is why it is so important.	2.679677496672307
This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled.	5.2851238455403005
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	4.068612438315064
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	3.8311782518874202
It cannot create jobs just by government spending.	3.3357733507294367
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	5.69856444229773
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	4.876515266818336
One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context.	4.000579448086841
Report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EEC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)	2.455191173027961
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.	3.714934419358758
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	3.364971129223287
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	2.942242818908905
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in.	3.599853109320603
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability.	4.532846848281043
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.	4.58483184684224
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether.	4.497994287513151
Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt.	3.4495014288654677
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way.	4.773702733940313
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed.	2.3454201229229454
Those could perpetuate an infection.	2.986815376228785
In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme.	4.632484785434662
After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.	3.1677614131034817
Postal services must continue to be public services.	2.7464139456192815
I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required.	4.580851008415072
It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly.	3.6849026391651765
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	3.6368212022963613
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union?	3.278677153740233
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop.	5.436886271861536
Some of them are our ACP partners.	3.3380289213469565
On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred.	3.6895502451691535
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	4.9806022348675345
The vote will take place on Thursday.	2.8971735747523075
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	2.2379102893476417
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	4.106563356263569
Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.	5.095259705856169
Mr President, I too believe that tourism has a very important role to play, not just in our European regions, but throughout the world, because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development.	5.32300871088521
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	5.066723796384055
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.	4.147797417819717
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	4.003849105345311
In addition, the Commission ' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.	3.5160172656837334
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.	4.134170525888682
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	3.1667320381890933
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.	2.496440535484832
Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped.	2.8538777779601507
They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.	3.225455831727387
VOTE	1.083590840144401
It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace.	3.7250761951973805
As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately.	3.7955148947482176
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.	4.2929685857757995
Calling under these circumstances, as he does in paragraph 20, for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House.	2.7575598493769236
It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there.	4.171667899392483
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	4.497820532668952
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.	4.037712952771567
Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.	3.235023335381612
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	2.844824042660663
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.	3.25684620932645
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	3.706636331504513
The next item is the report A5-0035/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS).	2.849152090498592
We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up.	4.113582377818602
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.	3.948432790497222
It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding.	3.8345943323420233
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	3.925532220710704
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	3.6322676486317502
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.	4.7663245217706205
This needs to be said!	6.030053038269483
The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water.	3.6492002184863894
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.	3.575709364513467
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.	4.405659058050515
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo ' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	3.379591723362225
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.	5.6449674189834225
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform	4.308683853103254
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.	4.256519138842157
We need, in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe, to go back to the natural order of the universe, i.e. to the Creation, and beyond that still further, to the Creator ' s intention.	3.235909888831075
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent.	3.3958418068829572
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.	3.7677782156969597
You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission ' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	3.270274841654122
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months ' time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000.	4.146914279745744
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint.	4.654092379633866
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy ' matters which we need to go into.	4.2977699751975
(FR) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle, the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP, i.e. their former colonies.	3.9883496535710496
Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August.	3.477466648510176
This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun.	3.3311749511942312
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.4860394600720443
The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter ' s prior authorisation.	3.7990290149144474
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	5.000781193281133
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	5.052784464401098
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	2.9639144593403426
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face.	4.4209324635792395
However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.	4.697628637413788
I say it again, the European Union ' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy.	4.97118573690896
Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important.	3.3000570883827653
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	3.9272929590520187
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	6.3449663788102955
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.	4.294303578704215
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.	2.4393514752137784
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation.	3.518931661909676
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?	4.664011810393513
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	4.2727579524119745
For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this?	5.314465655066169
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.	4.273188500359548
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	3.4451330024062843
What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism?	3.2615966159133465
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.	4.805599045686577
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.	2.6841136500692695
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months ' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands.	3.8447656427260437
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	4.4286347641412895
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	4.380821142785682
For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption.	4.3692020798837055
But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats.	3.5384959251097214
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	2.4516392362535555
In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges.	3.2974468233804
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	3.349867348020859
If we are to strengthen the European Union ' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action.	3.585747556383546
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	4.9288143174446
The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities.	3.6583134019188344
It is as simple as that.	4.141224900845322
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	4.498777290215706
Moreover, the concept of 'author ' is not defined in the Treaties.	3.3226837052714986
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	4.0576102857684235
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe.	2.8105484932261375
Here, in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact, it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a plan which is now being finalised, and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States, in Moscow, and to develop a set of further initiatives.	4.382765393969834
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	4.652941859675745
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	2.9907691787414836
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	4.099414306247207
We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	5.883676540021773
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	4.347282469048424
Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets, slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half.	2.6832140734383194
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	4.934083716644375
A further round was held in January this year, starting on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York.	3.1703568540493157
Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything.	2.9041541374835216
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	2.699702721292262
With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court ' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union ' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits.	4.197806523444477
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission ' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.	4.406409133531253
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.	4.700930991394822
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	3.4042031977756473
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	4.741392503258142
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	4.433503531839386
However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now.	4.02537435213976
With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	3.792874578675286
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.	3.194638569718865
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	3.3599345745920886
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	3.8487232380204586
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	3.798168654866137
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.	3.9526755518586123
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.	4.054471032855978
I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.	3.261493532185285
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	3.820149634321737
Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children.	3.565469485962575
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.	4.175001917709576
Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us.	3.763967463692125
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.	3.178848938449005
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected.	4.147522388814039
She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China.	3.8276001744059807
This issue is extremely topical.	4.122803114034719
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter.	4.764119743466508
Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference.	3.538556444694547
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana.	3.578305232777864
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union ' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.	4.314056745799817
The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values.	3.6114678781415
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.	5.843707677412028
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.	3.7760414770196515
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	2.5716121256249695
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	2.0009319592012798
In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy?	5.200188289787514
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	4.369183425584121
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive.	3.9779523131757024
Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher ' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.	4.3365341513916205
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	4.820216331647108
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.	4.658170567563638
The Commission ' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie.	3.4551603365206565
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	4.418634729524507
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	4.3463027495287925
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.	3.527097004511092
Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.	4.73543996925281
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	3.478343657798693
It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place.	3.010569341966924
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate, which all in all I have found to be encouraging and supportive, and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission.	4.739292692437728
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.	4.569287750601984
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.	4.153039861342404
This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection.	4.0334486444864615
The Council therefore, has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty.	3.5898591729183273
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union ' s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping.	4.518552848135122
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system.	4.805221122279134
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	4.930017516144745
This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle.	4.897556292851586
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again.	5.372677927216308
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	3.261363120646593
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.	3.037274156822571
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	3.7916053456302743
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people ' s health and the environment.	4.353399631818972
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.	3.098932439216692
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	4.1896796771115765
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind.	3.216987678519419
In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.	2.9812154996417957
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	3.408201087949426
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	3.508579794796185
I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed.	4.099421385607384
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.	3.540635943023667
These are questions which we should all be asking, but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.	3.223918176816888
Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.	3.8170565617046055
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	4.527776248057242
The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars.	3.9095997712473687
Will it do the same to us?	3.1650377944428376
They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive.	4.226750095292559
Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it.	3.8856919007943183
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.	3.765906309444605
Thirdly, unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time, tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes.	4.054262023462317
The Member States have spent similar amounts.	5.656651988490356
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	3.9776951883383167
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.2028131983846255
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	3.571163897894697
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.	4.850577716726844
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	2.63347110793812
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.	4.164674952274286
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives.	4.516752923314583
So we need to do this.	4.1101785263313655
As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet.	4.3556781178196555
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	4.410319333931424
Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards.	3.4643203660581583
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.	4.216301101364661
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	5.154397918457952
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	4.233047669558729
Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry, Mr Costa, and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed.	3.095338164665612
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?	3.8105851023873285
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children.	3.8568689227000688
At the same time, it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms, and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union, in the wake of the establishment of the internal market, the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy.	3.685740787407204
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.	3.2442827987012084
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC.	4.337197823938753
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field.	3.417685465156152
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.	4.751806753876497
First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.	3.9133960657725977
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	3.4519860358446706
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	4.042927552620731
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail.	3.563769690180897
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report.	3.1206083025312137
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive.	3.471913329739323
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	2.7402218891167958
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there.	4.205059434577127
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	4.347499465351662
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	4.267152907453903
That concludes the debate.	1.9556947861217602
We really have not progressed very far.	4.71925887223366
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way.	4.038971138554388
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?	4.251119647074447
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development.	3.33591978132027
It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so.	3.380377523576111
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	4.623191354270448
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.	3.803556076435529
Firstly, to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies, subsequently, following invitation to tender, to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations.	2.9795283929259493
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.	4.039049334651095
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.	3.9662569731939845
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts ' and 'standardised options ' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments ' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	3.5920325718762878
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	4.156555705338131
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4.	4.156987278469386
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	3.835258903511639
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.	4.111385880754833
If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason.	3.723954809993342
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	4.8979957225110775
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.	5.825231502030803
The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament ' s in-house service?	3.7712480669622286
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing.	4.8618856591693485
The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	5.2691078553340684
May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	3.2691605594137148
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.	3.2459015481166
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.	4.462403992330463
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.	3.7055658684653103
. (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive.	3.2497860569122703
This question covers several individual matters.	4.18873883247938
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.	3.3374757996782747
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month.	4.927692726058738
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	3.8137874222712864
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	5.510001977809009
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen.	4.481965144960419
But thank you for your remarks.	5.5954579397099025
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	3.811415943601709
It is a highly complex problem.	4.695199978657115
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	2.9483711469430616
The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover.	6.7140632797889035
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.	3.6804297039284184
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.	3.836504360979675
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.	4.357252441830728
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	4.355315776258011
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary.	3.209475076459263
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.	3.32715846853894
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.	3.4278152575621776
Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.	3.7538135382158
Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway.	3.850753675642531
No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private.	3.5773903130502904
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food?	4.37714581161616
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	4.432857226505806
Macedonia ' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries.	3.6240567613158876
(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	4.229822877206157
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	2.715090052988736
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!	2.819514014903892
Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement.	3.179187280589894
Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations?	3.3674293810764677
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.	3.635106794937966
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.	4.459876009005223
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	2.670278831016966
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.	3.3509465881335823
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	3.9660642630679774
, rapporteur.	2.444463319595333
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	4.3700442399324615
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000)	1.93055012108717
Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003.	3.650775400670861
These days, someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field.	3.304143874210127
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody.	3.2726685591337237
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well.	4.4095331196487315
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):	2.5020672571040974
However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity.	3.972319551527149
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	3.562132588378425
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	3.434997559618125
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.	3.7770655564593167
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.	3.9711948278709293
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.	4.469470976383401
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.	3.3875204081659063
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	3.5413434587407804
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.	3.8093488870205703
Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.	4.784930688260394
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	3.5290815925666372
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	4.107038579661099
In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today.	3.1772056741557626
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well.	4.216055197864901
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	3.565104109638696
	1.0363974359942942
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States ' policies with the European Union ' s development policy.	3.9799183643126166
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.	4.2360042182811055
The new Commission 's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office.	4.529841161519351
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer.	4.340436539230908
That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work, and we should recognise that.	4.019660643802995
We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.	4.356175611112977
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.	4.59953583541507
Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States.	4.30837493666469
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.	4.307429672212969
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.	4.122921128694462
We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one.	4.8375797635397255
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall.	4.084520326563551
Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.	4.533059062184261
Oz ' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press.	2.549505435794377
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.	3.847912087844516
(DA) Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.	2.9376363952237527
Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong.	3.3494151779321926
-	2.2318028971929302
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives?	5.177791299672851
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	4.226793119555789
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.	8.261590458638594
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.	3.598587364986801
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	3.589508839981137
(IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay ' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission ' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.	4.2646689389207655
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	2.2132572479870762
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	3.4873678763303397
We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.	5.138905829549569
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it.	4.157928584458252
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	3.741709149375231
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government?	3.897892399571983
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe, tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union ' s regions.	4.407914833852916
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.	3.8079459840398617
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union ' s fundamental objectives.	6.108467018778106
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.	6.658794925182896
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.	4.361864603282172
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission ' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	4.258025094957773
As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million.	3.6561216891636072
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.	4.458733923196603
We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments.	3.704454659094025
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	4.056862810452498
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order.	3.9525529691025194
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission.	3.71730415767399
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge.	5.083697469425588
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way, and this is unacceptable.	4.4566980614572556
All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa.	3.1582595507154037
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.	5.041053878278118
Is this actually how we want things done?	3.140501896895297
In our opinion, the Commission ' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	5.3084524388602725
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	3.213127488283045
All laudable stuff.	4.329483102558426
We want EQUAL to go ahead.	4.0132899535161295
That is also mentioned in the report.	3.3228095964386775
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.	4.416736531930044
Furthermore, he considers that "genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document, official or otherwise, which is affixed to or accompanies the additive" .	2.9006706202055517
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive.	4.62736407156215
If they yield, they are lost.	3.6965312348587696
These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics.	3.3485538969608237
I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt "extremist" amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers.	3.802453395160267
We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	3.646784411634119
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	3.8458320568295203

Subject: Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament.	5.18269750327375
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	3.4688962409493382
I would like to explain our thinking here.	3.9842662305926133
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.	3.8483522471575413
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	3.5633055452006537
Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration.	3.5149910199591576
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.	4.53852230867062
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin 's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union.	4.177433774678195
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	3.745005164428511
(Limited applause)	1.7374337359860184
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	3.65210330939304
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.	4.999257086103449
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	4.332560847449412
Quotas alone are not enough.	1.9501321959808655
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers" .	4.262683702178018
Another example is cacao.	3.7556879969634447
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	3.7543350935548037
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire. '	3.4983102497909373
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	3.4879066081728847
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.	3.2246381247426044
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	4.404930105015195
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings.	3.2911848729713706
Still relating to Thursday ' s sitting, the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda.	2.8524344579855883
So what is the European Union doing about it?	5.744302649829262
First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed.	3.097695660860368
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.	3.8118327061033033
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission ' s proposal.	4.225653974443318
All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.	4.085688498694666
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	3.93378406945525
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	2.6359027341267325
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	3.955664088259531
ALTENER	2.6862442414591623
I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice.	4.595034343289918
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure.	4.752047427121139
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year ' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	3.0892402995929196
(Applause)	1.0254732203547985
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	3.473400339421052
Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.	3.67767335569325
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.	4.064781291805257
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.	3.847828026737373
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.	4.650481756925834
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	4.565825063014471
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.	4.301438765557425
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	2.9882029155023586
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.	4.781963873225087
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States.	4.611712002680643
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	4.302052111363909
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	3.166139590454555
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	3.0176186429934635
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen.	2.374075468780368
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament ' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.	3.533183701500602
The fact that the Council ' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group.	5.01550596653806
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2147807662314045
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.	4.215732007722766
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	3.648955977995988
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	3.87215186174956
The important thing is for money to generate more money.	3.7890892174892934
They need a 'European soul ' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.	2.9464206853007098
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	3.9349507716931966
In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect.	4.826718871883123
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman ' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	3.9888276706571397
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	4.448356960940623
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	4.007052632986998
An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.	3.3092450934194586
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services.	2.8262383880796897
In my view, it is, therefore, immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and, consequently, to study and approve the provisions referred to here.	3.0662576766264253
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	3.4659407330445036
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?	4.265431039248335
