Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.	1.6065905350625842
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	2.2893957895472203
That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.	2.335669131618441
I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.	3.2864612492461345
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.	2.4550294438067493
If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result.	1.730314866039676
In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field.	2.214439153351414
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.	2.3247593365279453
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	1.8913131968260466
It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor ' s Office instead.	2.495495856935351
I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.	2.565618515331322
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	2.2763285998318823
This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.	2.520181589714513
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	2.5841265584979207
We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further.	2.208230254174925
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	1.8915336092884405
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	2.4975074931958265
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	2.398500263189934
A fault confessed is half redressed.	2.2683459933325323
This is my first point regarding the policy.	2.682282524175234
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament.	2.843852291065441
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative.	2.59616298527568
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	2.11985494777346
Secondly, apart from the shipowners ' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	2.2287783117426927
I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.	2.2138659947672505
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	1.8286269440900025
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	2.2533550171609638
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention.	2.7891819106441815
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier.	2.698632629096513
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	1.888946253569196
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	2.475376253678866
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.	2.1023117336175394
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.	3.0550308456717543
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote.	2.6605983855999487
Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.	2.3235262902062432
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	1.9300880073349902
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	2.948934152290307
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive.	3.3254447941141625
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes?	1.8327913009074404
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	2.4675148285001907
Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states.	1.796672835682497
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	2.272642064398618
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	2.1514278004884986
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country ' s democratic process.	2.1367686655648246
At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas.	1.9217646748417474
Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission ' s and Council ' s efforts in this respect.	3.0241517061882948
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.	2.3971126182748614
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial.	1.9447391138118175
Mr President, I see two problems with this morning ' s debate.	2.1388869352725433
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.	2.4312346230533555
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal ' s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position.	2.4844530764317483
AIDS treatments that may cost $18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $5 per capita.	1.395052168337269
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	2.893268641916527
Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions.	2.0646198215686593
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	2.315819827427974
I look forward to Parliament ' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward.	2.6434461634563
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	2.3383030716065654
So, unification in this small area.	1.9567544432624004
What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.	2.1836857396456555
It must form the basis for our partners ' political will.	2.726298254582249
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us?	2.102685914638377
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community ' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	2.289326598812998
Thank you, Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council.	2.0945303801314274
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day?	2.138807067490114
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.	2.0787805692338392
Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission ' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period?	2.275916050800963
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe.	2.0696647719654426
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.	2.474075812395365
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility, for the fifteen Member States of the Union, of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy, a sensible European Union initiative in this field.	2.18880517659549
Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union ' s budget but the EDF remains outside it.	1.9480874964618478
Here, then, I want to point out that international competition is tough and, if we are to overcome it positively, we must together envision and share a long-term strategy.	2.2064748673539283
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	2.6802499399352038
I hope that the Commission will not forget that.	3.5665949216114887
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks.	1.8447215894785343
This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle.	2.863360508097957
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.	2.653328843563707
However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission ' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.	2.2644893930859897
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon.	2.2981861202289258
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union ' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	2.397238738016995
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	1.5911521482983602
It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez.	1.9089266181025497
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment.	3.079442229370167
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	2.2959804991102377
These possibilities should be fully exploited.	2.690487845745505
I would like to answer these two questions as follows.	2.4553749241652953
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta ' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	2.656763453187111
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	2.731916325820929
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then.	2.555281037417328
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.	2.0488578389312715
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy.	2.7383967372070877
I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path, which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union, we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine.	2.6174691768646503
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	1.9829066866984368
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	2.3905009206344037
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.	3.256022160803947
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	1.9344518205570163
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	2.4905028076541362
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	2.3728452692650452
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.	1.8118932017027192
There is no freedom without rules.	2.1972876578351683
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	2.958039474413993
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	1.8896801235090637
A man with three children and he was murdered.	2.121922874783557
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	2.5097350479791034
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider ' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	1.8674865707492156
My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	1.7800086925658467
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community, reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe?	2.0150748511565726
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.	1.657077701963034
Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled.	2.218597431483268
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.1058126353916964
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.	2.4367853705362483
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.	2.507277297191486
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	2.6636375085976223
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	2.0670317911740277
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	2.1421596559165486
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State.	2.4427017131802633
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	2.0005782769900984
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?	1.874032482319049
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget.	2.301055948759345
With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another.	1.8899946790328959
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	1.75367080250142
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	2.2771869306922565
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government.	2.8156095936598637
For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena.	2.3008203401311818
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	1.9640036134060541
Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock ' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated.	1.9173255014512742
Mr President, in Kotka, in Finland, there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals, which is sailing under a flag of convenience.	1.8458777840311953
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.	1.8714559264800035
Do not take too long to send it back.	1.8589679323924428
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.	1.6538521023912327
This means putting forward the Commission ' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	2.485132507505176
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	2.6233798386443605
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission ' s proposal.	2.1820571067679957
However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection.	2.2989288689712355
We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies. We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU ' s external action.	2.3629404085193593
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.	2.2511518404586868
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	3.2173706519524674
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days.	2.6971912387535553
Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):	1.7707818057820397
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment.	2.1964816447169553
The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy.	1.7951100282638368
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	2.0713717447440536
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	2.7766267027327958
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned.	2.082783932998683
If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security.	2.007201961161898
Question Time (Commission)	1.8469571105543827
This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend.	3.078109883982923
And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago.	2.166978302458482
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.	2.556642903765077
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	2.382364206189706
This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively.	3.1194212593542865
It was this practice which led to the Commission ' s downfall.	3.585017605214053
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it.	2.364454420233779
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	1.6735537054679903
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years ' time.	2.8580250485865637
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	2.181344343519099
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	2.0743996949477372
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	2.3320764768602
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food.	1.474321400997145
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	2.076104557024082
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d 'intention.	2.2739436571484193
I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick.	2.419923110822393
However, in moving forward, what should we be financing?	2.241294447797783
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	3.2921126329451114
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.	2.308801299509844
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region.	2.2573929905590298
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	1.9011342441562007
Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything.	1.7066016852427643
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries ' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.	2.0533460541462163
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.	2.12242053754098
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.	1.6465638235884648
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.	3.2434685565800527
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.	2.157977896845631
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	1.9907174450441238
The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU ' s treaty concerning the manufacturer ' s liability.	2.7913365976695785
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.	2.6086017684602023
Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.	2.200364577382984
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions.	2.3714289388556056
. (PT) Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate.	2.468466385601055
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate.	2.384718889469766
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole.	2.305674076872579
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.	2.7300890284155264
Relating to Friday: President.	1.4100714478107872
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre ' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States ' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important.	2.23737286638613
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.	2.200186220343792
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	2.4118540849260475
That, however, is not my question.	1.6397023325390614
These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency ' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets.	2.4732545114246443
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	2.0993180174317403
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission ' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold.	2.7335894377332517
The first is greater transparency.	3.0920873176456825
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	2.7087489202253305
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	2.007130202341717
Mr Marinos, we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, the cultural dimension is, I am sure you will appreciate, one of our main concerns.	2.492144571068522
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.	3.068824099450117
However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people.	2.6813861262597247
When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying.	2.5207668578319264
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	1.7453051511156166
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, ELDR and PSE Groups.	2.756979845368439
They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.	2.31968239709214
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.	2.9947528463194466
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	2.149912357319519
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe.	1.8866842155349761
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	2.8382808774332045
The Commission ' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.	2.403917939169667
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	2.150063125480888
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	2.231727318412823
In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.	2.987787655775469
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	2.4578664641624832
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU ' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica.	2.0939606712465544
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	1.3536628466657705
With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled.	2.1351610249173194
In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world.	3.07643857959688
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.	2.1533145907145053
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	2.0162680832297024
We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.	2.0118678313169926
(FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	1.8688144137227234
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	2.342502760850944
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	2.4038307981360876
This service must therefore be kept public.	3.5023939308266594
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences.	1.4124361138511683
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.	2.5386415075130033
b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels	1.5619925466337314
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.	3.1076584949545127
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004).	2.634746439273088
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	2.3638862632915254
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual ' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.	1.805414302808286
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	1.8546777212937722
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people ' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission ' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	2.266752030001661
LIFE ' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment;	2.8101149507497203
Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled.	1.7825808248459842
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	2.296190537880337
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.	1.9291831153648746
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.	3.1075400575968084
In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step.	1.9919459866878921
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually.	2.0923261225960474
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	1.960695481252877
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	1.5189484627980878
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	2.2000627013640903
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	2.2323124541524226
Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as well as the amended version.	2.3979329244815624
Some of them have already lost several years ' worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea.	1.6870493053832296
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.	2.643706109731447
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.	2.4803534830370393
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.	2.658191633664921
As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another.	1.8496882224656386
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	2.1928176712219103
This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.	2.6461313272034475
It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance.	2.782937630898961
They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties ' commitments under the agreements.	1.8946355324841946
Before the vote	1.7137106681949799
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?	2.252684123504298
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate.	2.8078144367227926
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen.	1.8321384704665156
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention.	3.1661187775228035
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	2.211601434747782
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	2.1813432690466397
Think of last year ' s deadly criticism of the Commission ' s lack of propriety, ethics and accountability.	2.129749283009319
It is also 'confusing ' .	2.521543907600467
This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group.	2.922219491884979
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support.	2.1365771391097845
Madam President, the Socialist Group proposes the following oral amendment.	2.2063741119698754
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?	2.48789278172211
I shall read it in English, which is the original language of the resolution.	2.479069844949482
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.	2.837051688414692
The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future.	2.516302928291222
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.745750118902646
I therefore support the Commission ' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation.	3.068812661440221
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is.	2.159765649782335
In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date.	2.1222884771301733
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	1.9527362429151454
Forgive me Mr Poos.	1.297262991665829
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers ' and employees ' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.	1.899447105593924
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe.	2.562807496590192
The next item is the report A5-0017/2000 by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament: Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment (COM(1999) 363 - C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155 (COS).	2.106441116785566
Parliament ' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades.	2.2399403065772017
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.7737084791327264
Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.	2.37649724856683
Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.	1.6469416835152686
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	2.1413797715421587
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.	1.8064092154439226
Like the whole of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have therefore voted against the proposal to amend Directive No 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend Directive No 2.	2.2380103545327388
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	2.802887499211361
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.	2.1036212884886334
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations.	1.6553713422649323
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups.	1.9883830720172244
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	1.9345128862886105
Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission 's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality.	2.7114385221829704
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.	2.1613806497664867
Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.	1.7895721038026056
It must be visible.	2.6462362796255876
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.	2.629087581692555
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help.	2.744168539680062
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there.	2.5689003836905937
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	2.1554629948582624
I think that we need, first and foremost, to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations.	2.2715326738733883
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid.	2.608875128989563
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	2.152357434509503
Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.	2.5106307868289104
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation.	2.4774482282347496
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	2.1050977442769883
What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function.	2.0615331007476594
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.	1.8271359739196171
So what should we do?	2.271167024688811
Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.	2.1051819646929375
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	1.55321511664359
But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment.	2.511669682874882
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more.	3.5060049252972103
Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse.	1.5953877414151707
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade" at all.	2.2369429387088893
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.	1.6476208136396078
I believe that, in accordance with Article 69 (2), we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission, and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee.	2.7494716739711236
Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists.	1.927444616440205
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission ' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	2.957781894175348
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	2.9548633128089565
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	1.8411919572175581
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	2.7865733888674047
It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States.	2.074591242437182
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false.	2.3667211595876756
We will talk about this on another day.	2.7321669797150787
I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.	2.275922776257937
Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	2.135021305650117
I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge.	3.1854126150732496
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	2.6826903917711715
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.	3.250278882450182
Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism.	1.7236781450662273
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	1.7453051511156166
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	2.5610521180115335
But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.	2.236427754966575
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security.	2.71588655308482
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	1.4047515434942348
And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently.	2.490592119714647
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement.	2.2156455175097207
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.	2.044441372948682
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe ' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood.	2.485464012417253
To conclude, the next five years will be crucial.	2.159264201497578
It also creates protection for software and databases.	2.418031911503397
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.	3.1103027996876516
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	2.866966311138121
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.	2.332249859634359
I should like to mention a few specific points.	2.597645571970361
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.	2.9063815476656054
Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years.	2.322725722124721
In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation.	2.3228028886898224
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers.	2.074257548678356
Do forgive me.	2.2078371019567027
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	2.5555362219390525
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.	3.0059537964476837
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve.	2.4861007199454224
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.	2.8771170772324584
I shall take the floor very briefly, Madam President.	2.836564249286884
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.	1.8391013434504462
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	2.503098635324311
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed.	2.901584744712164
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.	1.996977472793477
Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities.	1.822236636099587
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur ' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	2.935674689884316
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?	1.668767711680159
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.	2.628569522273057
Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.	2.130361498134762
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	2.770857005289179
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	2.3313354679164884
I cannot accept this.	3.4173465591897707
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.	2.786162079694938
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex.	2.55712358065679
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers.	2.557362452051911
Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer.	1.647565835562315
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	2.731864493375945
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.	1.8437690611937
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour!	2.164639190391036
Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war.	1.8276473968089693
In 1910, a woman ' s right to vote was on the agenda.	2.2331811162435744
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	2.3457100961540003
This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment.	2.136865495399895
We are of the opinion that the Member States ' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	3.0041149971033376
For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia.	2.9451437461019347
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	3.0389897155581576
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.	2.2411204925896833
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.	2.2575870249671226
By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector.	1.7603705124816813
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	2.5513936616615687
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	3.108025382061642
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.	2.495900900878602
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom.	1.6154655792350994
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.	2.6935852103823286
However, the thing that worries us most, Mr President, is the decrease in prices, by 30%, owing to imports.	1.8891410591298605
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	2.2173125877742836
After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time.	2.3442600048564044
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically.	2.176215889865489
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	1.743859688739256
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	2.1293324534554725
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	2.1514694479380982
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	2.3094880720960025
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	2.0756688897983477
It must be seen to deliver.	3.1177217129291677
Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.	2.1625351057796607
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.	2.415345459687812
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.	1.9915903367791203
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	2.2002478999230726
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period?	2.2158699273899667
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):	1.841717536243728
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	1.9168169358094171
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	2.543724122813769
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.	3.5838817211119935
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.	2.1114768636019736
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.	2.4541933070714035
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	1.874645127229789
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.	1.6304443777277096
And it is still on the agenda today.	2.8211825627993394
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.	2.314845037477382
As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	2.440776278175631
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	2.309200008284686
Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises.	2.242263625082394
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement.	2.7494725656900654
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	2.470939709074355
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed.	1.9528912524168398
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	2.736715931947339
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries.	2.895213865224078
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	2.03432377010354
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.	2.8939676936889196
For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one.	2.1080392113301523
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer.	1.6420494770996386
We are losing market share.	2.9639181372934593
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost.	2.3452516721727004
With regard to the environmental impact, it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions: pollution, over-fishing, changes in climate, etc. It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock.	1.8255301343267722
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	1.955612590989447
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.	2.7877400536027026
I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time.	1.9567816825256
Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation.	2.673113700570035
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	2.867159190766773
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.	2.4516075673985926
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	2.9911119475656993
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	2.555568892455147
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.	2.397922265167319
It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.	2.2128906866633615
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues.	2.5869983381472346
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.	1.8406063668836266
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States ' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure.	2.13839236124633
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	1.6759679764053579
I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos ' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.	1.8874492594406092
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	2.4205674925155045
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	2.379127646189859
I would also like to support Mr Titley ' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.	2.2742274191682186
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.	2.6475099435343448
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment.	2.325848138018838
On behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	2.3880435916073552
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	2.059889873833058
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office.	2.3153755140191166
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.	2.4153293029386504
My Group has included two reasonable requests.	2.0276638425212434
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	2.8411209364824614
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.	2.27872752461764
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities ' . The European Union ' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.	2.54286924352438
I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance.	2.063062349866063
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands.	2.4447413951137027
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.	1.8669223118586666
Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect.	2.3781375608764117
We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again.	2.6055147095480344
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.	4.247111798875163
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.	1.9399184382610706
Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.	2.157686548294909
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe.	3.020292705373117
But this new course of action is very exciting.	2.3955294487465078
(Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes)	1.7754490162124168
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	2.912421935323587
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	2.3950081479017817
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process.	1.7366788382848888
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.	2.999208463824885
Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.	2.013694066511135
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	2.1914044114284104
We need, in short, to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these.	2.2130697463234243
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.	1.9275253294766306
Unfortunately, we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb, Romany, Turkish, and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next.	2.149980673315047
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.	2.079526530965491
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.	2.412624208618621
Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children.	2.026835409974069
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	2.2044003164339516
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union.	2.772055091447147
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.	2.006785481713536
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	2.5621034975379677
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.	2.6934409369493566
At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future.	2.202244305193245
But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets.	2.8043817040518704
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days.	2.1914333042346934
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	2.4246541950940883
The first question, then, is about who should pay.	2.562716116319875
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.	2.384562348897511
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	2.33127559150692
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice.	2.9073391068428003
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous.	2.0663849163288623
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation.	2.849459046415207
As this is the first Valentine ' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease, the biggest killer in the European Union.	2.468957399124584
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed.	2.1286215687496117
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency ' s position even more apparent.	2.13613931832326
I should like us to take a leading role in this work.	3.0347776612857396
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	2.461857002644874
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	2.2562611303156546
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	2.6432354978721473
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	2.3840885128025513
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	2.017271897284642
A further round was held in January this year, starting on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York.	1.848772623513926
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction.	2.6716562379408924
That is absolutely absurd.	2.9034091675690035
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.	3.1794221458717296
No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.	2.435379174516129
It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts.	1.9706442212519384
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk.	1.5649459583265855
The first is a policy of persuasion.	3.336842524229228
Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.	3.0618717076200364
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	2.743391873031551
It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market.	2.2316371278334852
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.	2.9831287358368024
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	2.531216611124421
In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.	2.3836777330588257
Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming.	1.5762923084534377
I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.	2.177098596212253
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars.	2.460078662472184
Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward.	2.213223761466303
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	2.065729200506383
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.	1.7160949321500418
Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.	2.1961487800821096
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	2.701433258103648
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.	2.6324694373252777
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	2.3808100245186834
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	2.232146387171045
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.	2.454971884924784
Oil slick off the French coast	1.596538137793466
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	2.061022986358759
In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement.	1.9329957150552084
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.	2.2815754752253654
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.	1.925111747864509
Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty.	2.149090277272663
What is to be done with this money?	3.773045510460238
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?	1.7668944465815497
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	2.161590146568764
Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs.	2.702641559238263
A large section of the Union ' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.	2.425073267781693
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach.	2.064892491010346
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	2.2185908144036377
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.	2.6033549911162646
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	1.6239098036454396
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.	1.9690842624610365
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	2.0815213609257737
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	2.2876894022248973
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.	2.1906428366753268
Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention.	1.573058992677232
Another important area is protection of the groundwater.	2.089076226894225
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion.	2.9919993774976663
In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater.	2.2070131287107726
The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result.	2.7909663603982433
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.	2.3221603478117356
Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it.	2.28334084567693
However, I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway, the A32.	2.0618917463560535
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.	2.6330391851002823
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted.	2.3898429485033503
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending ' in this House, and I thank you for it.	2.3739847139175096
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	2.5637620400409458
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	2.310966553122759
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.	2.7362084668568825
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.	2.791690497973292
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.	2.0755309302028135
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	2.489144763400596
It did not work; poverty became worse than ever.	2.335113871966699
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.7737084791327264
But there has been nothing for a year.	2.808505708750846
I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States.	2.5999365708211197
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	2.027869447695161
During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures.	1.760317373770565
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors.	2.4758853840860753
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	2.706542960697634
The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern.	2.6812550325074445
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.	2.5215691174033816
I understand that Portugal is affected by this.	2.5708782353567594
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	2.5683356985420485
Are there any comments?	1.2644728256185398
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	1.9617072392347616
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public.	2.9227160511295107
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3647183468043427
In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	2.447281296262241
In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments.	2.2660589990683166
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	3.1237865447857667
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	2.1924671758387624
Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.3269015478757478
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.	2.2193520374075226
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	2.29691159093662
I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by ' be replaced with 'dealt with ' throughout Amendment No 37.	2.1373707969880438
Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations?	2.2246341856478136
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	2.1940808369181037
These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits.	2.1980970073950696
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years ' imprisonment.	2.0167040014861053
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.	2.7910045124063325
The topic touches the very core of the European Union.	2.7366995958019205
She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China.	2.0553588795811404
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	2.0762201241230454
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees.	2.6838940303828096
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.	1.7358452048959836
(FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again.	1.812424409287494
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	2.6346857803114347
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	1.8471357197772251
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal.	2.421181728520504
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	2.458872450588078
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.	2.6129405844156945
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	2.1821265285699156
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position.	2.51628749451048
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now.	2.136343786802214
Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided.	2.4837548460299708
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	3.4015542037433777
Cultural activity creates identity.	1.4929553220583391
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	3.500422651166035
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	2.02402900391734
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.	2.4690802887219934
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	2.5045671803531246
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	1.7771447763263768
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	2.9631742513148875
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
Thus, when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe.	1.9558894780018274
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	2.4158700129624404
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.	2.0894049958068956
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.	2.620725109757344
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	3.3134909424857346
Lastly, there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière ' s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual.	2.528127435655703
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	2.5784933982656404
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	1.733148928539518
Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life ' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment.	2.3028142703883394
. As regards the Commission 's position with respect to the amendments tabled by Parliament I wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this House on Tuesday, 15 February.	2.87665381749057
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee.	2.2819811558399303
We must never forget to defend civil society.	2.4670367502078707
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	3.081395428867509
I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.	2.133415916932073
This is not the way to fight extremism.	3.3119982720463317
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	2.1044973958649655
Parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	2.711292620424785
Such a concern is misplaced.	1.9327685785664483
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament ' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.1731845247698502
Supposed draft environmental directive: "European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain, during winter, a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and parks of the cities of Europe ".	1.603376860332028
Our objective, the committee ' s objective, the Court of Auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	2.2518928158556992
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately.	3.2704435457758647
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.	2.3143939346536797
By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.	2.0692748714500055
Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.	1.7713015584187108
The President-in-Office informed our committee that the current Portuguese presidency intended the CFP to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources. This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world.	2.312443679820978
The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission ' s powers regarding these issues.	3.088944398154312
So we need to do this.	3.1181149064941174
Let us stop the shadow-boxing. Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate.	1.6957775031293503
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	2.116655613453958
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East.	2.0665633790663813
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition ' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	2.103725285962201
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	2.409952552272057
Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual.	1.6663220815780406
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying.	2.805396902703163
In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate.	2.8326939744399158
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	1.9812507518475069
The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone.	2.170959344009481
Clare Short, MP, is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and, as such, can take her case to the very heart of government.	2.0614016457964675
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
Thank you for the presentation.	2.3456430912448902
And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community.	2.081763875445292
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière ' s report.	1.9602213722078863
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	1.366612833496009
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society ' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".	2.329523841896353
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.	2.0157840187801934
Secondly, to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds, in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism.	2.2217160154810554
That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little.	1.9635790470489325
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.	2.955666574120637
So I believe that we should take today ' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.	2.7981560393508977
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	1.9821848874158003
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	1.6388313063722442
This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda.	2.527601998721889
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.	2.6771289011795245
I am in favour of social protection, I am in favour of the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high.	2.6348316105258136
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.	2.408699984443605
The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide.	2.9461265285623863
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.	2.1053049460815636
(Loud applause)	1.0445699450791264
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	2.1987721047658844
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.	2.56833615046158
As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.	2.3440461338662244
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	2.5581653179948867
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa, where violations are viewed as a necessary evil.	2.2245289151845835
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.	2.551978241313482
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	3.0138859927946395
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.	2.517816033017703
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	1.9183120354418934
Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those.	2.020332745822009
Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market.	2.3163658022010334
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	2.2460421754366777
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	2.3830812532441743
.	1.374839594702952
The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.	2.3693221304205183
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.	2.561674547164323
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries ' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU.	1.814369179359378
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
It has clear, ambitious objectives.	2.887884532030794
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO ' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.	2.8660602375035364
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission.	2.092546741065746
The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact.	2.4192137520104438
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.	2.3143150108416686
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.	2.1975509324417355
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	2.5388194028901103
This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.	2.340721097188114
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	1.7312034593530325
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union ' s democratic role.	3.147708682084283
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.	2.12225703584998
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana.	2.668412528760067
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence.	2.285836428200621
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	2.30398952596694
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	1.96037781282071
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.	3.000889453830558
What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.	2.6000870863564276
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	2.086606839685807
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect.	2.730324474792805
With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money.	2.0494707653761797
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival.	2.790120106388169
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	2.395134672742995
The main objective of the Union ' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	2.9326414287251437
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	1.8710198555334079
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied.	2.3068783749798647
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative.	2.0570930291414946
The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.	2.170768762272277
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation.	3.203108444718416
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	2.156917230399405
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties, opening new prospects for this partnership.	2.0938792953445997
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.	2.5818807406978213
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	2.3401399049850267
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament.	3.1539195777190407
It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.	2.505024658590033
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector.	2.111110427382456
I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence.	2.5143446955801294
On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us.	2.459970206205425
Of course this is also the basic idea.	2.787333417465841
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions.	2.461443110816956
We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months.	2.2686384714061205
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	2.5200059285760172
Quite simply there is no question of this.	2.2274244873477587
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	2.4934887948161486
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework.	2.4027182282673474
It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.	1.930225969722865
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.	2.1530112751180326
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	1.885867433247309
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds.	2.2258181839976516
On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999.	2.0270005068591432
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	3.5072728845248653
A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases.	1.7998580569556626
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission.	2.577422413094397
There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union ' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts.	2.556006981174574
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership, even under cover of environmental protection.	1.9154596322287383
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	2.504931096870193
All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates.	2.7039874436157927
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	3.130016658854217
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.	2.4148776121868742
In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side.	2.6068903837262987
Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate.	2.0553916114001693
Many of the report ' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.	1.8172685210121142
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	2.1971683809985194
Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process.	3.154735894769803
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	2.4721000637400343
We must do this for the sake of the environment.	2.57322066627386
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	2.3315136073789855
Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible.	1.8946118542871193
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.	2.134128722812001
It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations.	2.384822095119823
For example, it has not been defined.	3.112084096976686
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.	2.2176242717084684
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	1.8121634830310318
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	2.546960656615767
This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.	2.5102228122884025
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	2.5863435217756416
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.	2.074090277802656
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.	1.9202879885854558
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.	2.42886241616721
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	1.9075553212591176
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.	1.741545646776662
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	1.8036184511485116
Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental.	2.0921994104007244
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	2.4017599775290055
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations.	2.943546200765248
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.	2.4878405307972757
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people 's health, particularly in the case of small children.	2.386695924782073
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control.	2.8061933816086895
For the Commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence.	1.872842864090981
Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality.	2.1636183736016776
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.	2.120712036617523
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free.	2.2872410910056398
Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.	1.7818247155007347
However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.	1.9831711228699322
At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.	2.014821717222987
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	2.560198496708867
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.4716188326280957
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.	1.7911671064469017
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	2.181922484163353
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	3.135096068865831
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	2.5127276699960257
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.	2.642424023427441
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	1.8708388883730265
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test.	2.8350163354697915
This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island.	2.4294829240790463
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	2.7726744162113803
In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.	1.9806816100119842
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.	1.9475893100753245
More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity.	2.161671587074348
In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights.	2.7201861590651037
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today 's session.	2.796441614668557
Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	2.4647435153734842
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union ' s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter, so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens.	2.733677031676205
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote.	2.8335981864955273
It has been a useful debate.	3.243991277811718
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion.	2.6425790621392657
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4.	2.4523378865124
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	1.9712636132726804
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy.	2.6264680493276664
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	3.098463529949483
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on.	2.5091586644799166
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	2.290673042508656
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	2.2191577399943716
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.591476154890115
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	2.9673711261186004
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters ' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground.	2.1073648650467756
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs?	1.6862715729593631
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard?	2.2552026244590624
For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.	2.3413942650203805
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.	2.379701254085144
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	2.5259734771651594
And indeed there is a twofold shift.	3.4346892069367687
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.	2.8706230019365164
Having listened to the Commissioner just now, we know that the Commission ' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no ' to the Tobin tax.	2.6280657828742364
The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone, is not workable.	2.399231499887543
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.457652188634284
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	2.118504125059441
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all.	2.2555851267145566
Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions.	1.5136912633837751
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car.	2.675788743226291
It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974.	1.8994816114913178
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	2.636987093892003
In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass.	2.0831910000248253
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	2.5234662979557965
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future.	3.170218188027031
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.	2.483436605665389
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.	2.4611313922472937
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	2.372343196832976
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.	2.5680956996043176
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	2.3998415979690013
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	2.008857705414683
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	2.4974032083332895
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.	2.1747685929142677
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently.	2.2660607064900335
The previous speaker already said something about this.	2.741389840835597
Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence.	2.6875343518464643
Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions.	2.0140689736924173
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.	2.7047584613749
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament ' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.	2.4450653979917827
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal.	3.1414273762273544
It is quite logical, it is consistent!	2.542299217298241
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	2.4018254819117693
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	1.7835781884536368
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative.	2.4817992060000313
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	2.037811610739979
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.	2.320959321657314
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society.	2.4339445273824976
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010, but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend.	2.454315506708735
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law.	3.3220684848894115
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	2.714497092525048
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with.	2.603236172259441
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	2.5011100049689863
All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business.	2.317223524530427
The staffing system is too rigid.	3.245666703716029
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	2.5232678692920536
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about.	2.977845866889146
In particular, we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue, and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage. This naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context.	2.4896485960921697
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age.	1.6729885416754615
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening ' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past.	1.9500949434999741
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand.	2.3827297412962465
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	1.9647428116827308
That is in line with the draft resolution.	2.6249177775511265
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	1.932622428396599
Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you.	2.0454228261836613
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down.	1.9954791944339043
Corinne Caillaux, who had probably been raped, was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train.	1.3652197414688554
Second, there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism.	1.9764963872709285
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned.	2.5798982806553785
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.	2.0556013539496667
By way of clarification: if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget.	1.8497817921112993
I do not know what the metric equivalent is.	2.5988686830842176
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	2.188959704580992
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	2.2604282405501346
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced	2.3031736321862804
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use.	2.8659735728481905
In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view.	2.703091392244325
We believe in 'one man, one vote ' more than 'one share, one vote ' .	1.9375117910472057
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	2.133899235133568
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	2.6537919834855046
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	2.3296776984345824
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union.	2.3702387636435667
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament.	2.6007074545881297
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.	1.8381481982558703
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	2.286310481994012
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.	2.681065817354381
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	2.2324920556512597
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars.	2.01643526704051
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.	2.1401485708060393
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?	1.8908455262518904
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court.	2.818000002198325
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.	3.0267979852810867
It is therefore easy to understand the public ' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them.	2.3758893152868685
According to the Commission ' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.	1.9475208464704792
Must there be an IGC?	1.424178804740488
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.	3.047970839928943
Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.	1.6744158086941545
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension.	2.187271411278872
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	1.8172777537322937
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	2.774547677258985
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	2.550902419604437
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	2.919893627911205
This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union ' s institutions towards the public.	2.527316941334097
This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999.	3.0563645460893962
Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States.	2.0203117849809598
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.	2.279950813748612
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.	2.432948982325011
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.	2.3431422614511
In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans.	2.2500161037851107
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.	2.0019244655367228
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn.	2.4189938214977844
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer ' s liability.	1.6273723597611327
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	2.416419590426501
In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President ' s position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today ' s Minutes:	2.409489011607926
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition.	2.7187654593845885
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation.	2.3609151918112508
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency ' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union ' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	3.378951201888754
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	1.6385291883553574
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	3.0506123223596417
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines.	2.612880179071893
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.	2.543639517788288
Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission.	2.391984153357514
I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started.	2.755845737816559
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party.	1.9602624817100902
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.	2.4461490774741725
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement.	2.324599718826265
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all.	2.1078760560392067
Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy ' even more degraded social provisions.	1.6357751270422445
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD).	1.9392254448091688
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	1.9957135305622424
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.	2.885075115031695
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	2.3840240194239013
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter?	2.8269538275418427
Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand.	1.769254340747112
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.	2.4914768791391286
Why is it so important in that sector?	2.0769338255821936
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	1.7770363283110238
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result.	2.4035083777441932
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment.	2.620851379468436
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission ' s supervision.	3.1365676566563163
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	2.750401271882668
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens.	2.9630217026929726
I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.	2.4833363918489093
But what then instead?	2.6956648551551736
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).	2.008967336808699
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	2.9776938787191787
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved.	2.2991863911511725
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.	2.0123580770654064
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.	1.743450050590153
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.	1.8421859883939273
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.	2.5321045919710743
However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State.	2.1916724918383115
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.	2.2182610437580665
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	2.061897245104994
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	2.805461006199038
Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.	2.3148207669430207
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	1.6492063485527089
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	2.299650850821103
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace.	2.8218647388438383
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.	2.8829345143955836
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	2.9968365781708894
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.	2.0920100958782477
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	2.1336159300696735
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding.	2.8500257746398345
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people.	1.8564382730284787
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently.	2.4519322942207626
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	2.3454757918220848
The industry is located in some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities.	2.60651558076892
Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident.	2.888320700256577
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards.	2.625331793274751
Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission 's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?	2.4324659947696525
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People 's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	2.399185013582159
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.	2.4318428289848826
Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives.	1.976579745644752
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation.	2.2153102399801323
Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.	2.0075492125821253
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	2.554225738233524
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.	2.225895580898846
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory.	2.227097258677192
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road.	2.686282475829283
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.	2.9370227601915664
We stand ready to do so.	2.857666657281001
The next item is the report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS).	1.9091226126073533
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	2.312301315610477
There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information.	1.9383964213951692
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	2.2872576937935922
These are questions which we should all be asking, but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.	1.9506636191033062
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	1.9303997600980374
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU ' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	2.4815647138484325
In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	1.7813044063598806
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	2.573887080358245
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission ' s attention to this issue.	2.17997831158277
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	2.410469316551929
Quotas are one of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change.	2.7117360318455295
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope.	2.085905817274895
No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.	1.8235957779127212
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy.	2.81560860915774
This is not the case!	3.4150964820623013
Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.	2.5517931061684638
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important.	2.3052334170817064
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	2.254993974217734
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.	1.9837196725624628
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	2.4577708613562415
We are not going to enter into a debate now.	3.1838123289308435
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon, which has been accepted, will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists.	2.1750170349176847
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	2.7183575470907453
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?	2.1359220168417536
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.	2.0542238861432662
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	2.6504075639621614
If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.	2.501460080949208
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	2.3996435674923555
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.	2.455890580152898
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people ' s access to the workplace.	2.0888445750826907
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.	2.2414614200659733
Fourthly, technically speaking, this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control.	1.9703576102149294
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.	1.7807931496262597
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.	2.442519367377802
We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment.	2.152421185424827
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter.	2.4635098893051097
In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.	2.1501589593087473
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	2.0318592056115907
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties.	2.9475857163957597
Women have different individual needs and interests.	1.765406385413578
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	2.9338363627492043
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections.	2.125770528811026
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	2.205255031311346
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened.	2.33767951470117
.	1.374839594702952
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	1.6239098036454396
Despite everything, we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington.	2.6328241368213363
It is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.	2.0737402548337234
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.	2.3139997118301987
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.	1.633349532988073
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government.	2.885065201491085
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.	2.4289688780817182
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.	2.3028747667376903
Will Syria fully accept Israel ' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law?	1.9232440228686476
Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries.	1.5903637665580297
Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made.	2.3172149218892324
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	2.726881220900005
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question.	2.756502882554914
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health.	3.1160782757467946
In 1988, the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men.	2.508559648640469
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	3.033450970110418
In my view, it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments, including this one, so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means.	2.823185488309624
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?	2.315951113164947
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council ' s functions as a legislative body.	2.718579519567472
Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	2.3201142274167306
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.	2.4086179688853973
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations.	2.317852782276697
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	2.9106101713005477
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.	2.4916070718520196
It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament ' s decisions on this subject.	2.78379153373241
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.	1.6721669038593685
ACP-EU Joint Assembly	1.8430047523104243
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work.	3.220117838652684
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently.	2.5982070802642294
Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.	1.756744035528292
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	2.3993200733967366
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.	2.562759533327682
The UN has a peace plan.	3.183109454741998
That is what this framework decision is about.	2.3945558286632904
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.	2.945565107616094
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	2.1238879107742785
Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do.	2.1492187749769465
There, it is mainstreaming which applies.	1.4962158927931881
Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on.	2.209617914099706
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	2.1036472424948776
This is also an important point.	2.9678819790319397
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	2.5925050722329512
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive ' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment.	1.9753324357606992
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country.	2.6192501171855938
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.	2.0705393167078125
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	2.4649298591018383
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres.	2.227175007679678
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	2.246918059346457
We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism.	1.887046320355205
Yugoslavia ' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.	2.08489236230276
This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds.	2.2264644151135933
- (EL) The Freedom Party ' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union ' s political future.	2.6870338743717586
This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is.	2.337069692486086
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road.	1.9901012985525222
Our rapporteur ' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded.	2.3358160236198247
I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it.	2.3071128583168803
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	2.4994798567362166
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment.	2.852794953726121
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.	2.1152716919813614
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.	2.5010203135020785
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries.	2.6440883853371235
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	2.2154888462634417
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	2.1995177770066188
Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere.	2.14157404056101
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	2.276168124180607
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	2.075043479784219
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.	1.8236031063142195
As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough.	2.14618765297641
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	2.0415312485190866
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.	2.4433090707396556
The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament ' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date.	2.012610358154128
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.	2.05637005921535
And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	1.9882814993051037
Like honourable Members, I welcome the United States ' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today.	1.8767075548943142
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	2.889339542652733
As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish.	1.9351343770732952
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.	2.251729176374759
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy.	3.189367055353425
In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally.	2.9835206799462655
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.	1.8333459115953539
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner.	2.9552678112997737
First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires.	2.354692049270981
We must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the AIDS disease are fully met. These countries include Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.	2.557991529908019
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	1.9844439405445826
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.	2.299605105551798
Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government.	2.2815753308316604
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	2.543748358802932
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	2.495187355242844
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.	2.1373336122275486
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.	3.3928655032682946
Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done.	2.7861088394559204
Resolution on the Commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	1.9144596422169873
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.	2.820893075203628
I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler ' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted.	2.5243481145861653
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	1.9037745339876444
We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley.	2.4766606561073323
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	2.4034002700781714
There are two fundamental questions in particular.	2.1675504321639063
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.	2.4078137269427726
Welcome	1.0963477464416975
The Committee on Women ' s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education, because according to official figures women account for 53% of those engaged in tourism services, and in parallel, they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change.	2.070810882392344
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.	2.7107952104458897
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	1.9518617082003595
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	2.383667952953708
In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological.	3.6193867678218243
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work.	2.1200109981678517
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	2.5632629981661523
Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt.	1.994021904154966
In theory, we could have done so.	3.036895863374111
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	3.133109279970858
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted.	2.6777188178612557
Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.	2.672638299515222
-	2.0184696698254547
As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis.	2.4342661597848894
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.	2.5003871424619533
When will you make it compulsory?	2.2567647849417387
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if . safe for human health and the environment" .	2.1162876651230005
A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.	1.9161840797288185
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields.	2.5872469232283817
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	2.014892320010355
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	2.5722085448336336
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.	2.5098895828070167
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%.	2.511607380243561
Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.	1.4314668424306196
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	2.46369663369257
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union ' s policies to date.	2.648001966596412
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.	2.48826076850914
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	2.525238174622733
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	2.445083091294423
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes.	2.1318405630130957
For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country ' s approval.	1.7492293932240905
More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation.	2.372105171356614
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	2.4560684063199463
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home.	2.223447616889317
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.	2.257469255405552
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?	2.4313539794553076
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.	2.499430143911544
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	2.3055214821121908
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners ' Party.	2.027741188481412
I was told that this was a personal response.	3.3456075789309185
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	2.4155065726447833
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana.	2.0482679927302723
Commissioner, this morning President Prodi, among others, stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively, the very credibility of the European Union is on trial, and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed.	2.1716290372568747
It did this as well.	2.9244750614365156
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering.	2.3965199277241997
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race.	2.6791504249612506
The time for resolutions has passed.	2.946927722035107
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	3.2661024520905144
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	2.283542505754598
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	1.5344171956084174
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.	2.818063406037001
The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources.	3.1194711235163566
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.	2.2925193774316486
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.	2.579321033124108
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!	1.8309224370812869
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.	2.8099473795248486
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider 's and the Freedom Party 's words, but also of their deeds?	2.3035818439478173
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.	2.6847219987267863
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	2.300723934383114
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	3.1666870787951984
This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms.	2.641894434666919
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry.	2.090321339427646
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	2.275541577028583
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur.	2.3175159160893783
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	2.1577699668546777
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	1.9796111893662758
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us, they want clarity; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote.	2.5363881054763193
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	1.6813954686233357
It worked for us.	3.307876764029817
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.	2.8899693190448033
B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain).	1.650535073974006
Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions.	1.4289093958167034
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.	1.7457080693811904
Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around.	1.8252785406750691
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	2.1305884697844237
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	2.3033855628328133
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.	2.394562550732356
It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area.	2.7643603642009125
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	2.622654562306021
Mr President, "The EU ' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired" .	2.692222673428534
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past.	2.5932728862965835
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.	2.532759908721752
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.	2.605883690404949
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	2.0259203649313595
I welcome you and your ambition.	3.3534745062204308
Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers?	2.2164616881081076
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.	2.2024617364684818
This argument is therefore not relevant.	3.2725515549747177
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members ' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.	2.2354552842349
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	2.668005653593602
Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country ' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations.	2.806386886946
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	3.0096416489953755
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	2.374964264743363
Concerning Mr Evans ' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.	1.9376457322224079
Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all.	1.983085864050661
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House.	2.0304806576955845
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy.	2.810460077735801
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.	2.2131261226054084
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.	2.318349054697712
These proposals must include a number of elements, an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies, a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan.	2.074907657906608
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.4716188326280957
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.	2.7894717483162426
The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services.	2.9183345362184396
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.	2.370881245162992
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	1.8880038148625076
We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.	2.3210161995492085
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.	2.2513121215244096
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.	2.6847478213844465
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	1.6559207422112145
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.	2.792259727969205
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	2.598236914358485
Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member ' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive.	1.8686337724872337
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.	2.971588007066631
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected.	2.9066041413763664
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?	2.026336305905081
The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties.	2.4088716542696385
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.	2.5297160362303366
Let me turn to some of the more important points.	2.7304893976924274
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.	2.7491238340234436
What kind of horse-trading system is this?	2.0817701041924344
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.	2.875243394440716
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market.	2.81488531989762
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	2.2926054056590033
Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water.	2.577217326101417
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain ' s Parliament if we are elected?	2.1284162346683377
Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative.	2.504905200395864
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights.	2.760499348949999
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development.	1.9159466619729812
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists.	3.5159365322796594
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view.	2.9981472144410017
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999.	2.183335272600483
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	2.312683836236072
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.	2.1413903398885723
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment.	1.7879552243990409
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.	2.2822259437530956
This kind of situation should not be allowed.	3.0574701463839418
In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.	1.8436037826615914
Second part	1.5642966609001037
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.	3.166337423698181
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	2.3326685606813387
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it ' s three times for a Welshman ' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	1.9045112733966612
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.	1.886983150718662
There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe ' s tourism and, to the extent of the possible, safeguard the operation of companies.	2.7503764231952306
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another.	1.5883598896655118
We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States.	2.017664597015167
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives.	2.280719693912826
Finally, even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies, there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected, and that is not the intention.	2.627830079398817
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them.	2.759302313942279
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	1.5186634845777764
- (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to.	1.8102247340321147
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year ' s work programme.	2.208035916388591
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	2.1961853004014817
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.	2.209123915833478
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.	1.9990613397878298
As I informed Mr Davies, I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors.	2.019664875136707
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.	2.210530992214254
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council.	2.596780273084103
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention.	3.2494175843645934
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	1.7615702264747946
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.	1.8808263724062013
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances.	1.7724444956415817
In addition, this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital, which is one of the central tenets of the internal market.	2.652207763001656
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.	2.1382341712428308
A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health.	2.4076249066669897
You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.	1.8724880425577184
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.	2.608858505178432
However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework.	3.017886175843118
In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.	2.165736259396085
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.4716188326280957
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	1.7634697134917006
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.	2.505147708855972
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	2.300487079428023
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.	2.8242084971797823
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.	2.24078481683952
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.	2.82682292786167
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	2.66875891099742
Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.	2.429851788202985
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	2.401441519939798
The first is the issue of the media ' s influence.	3.0678448337550943
Before the vote:	1.7430453723345385
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women ' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	2.168867408606199
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	2.8201889865381915
Does the Commission support the Council?	1.699206562615633
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.	2.170522176450631
I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.	2.402945890492722
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	2.7532402404479672
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.	2.067346993612573
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.	2.0634360603680486
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma.	1.8079233763497526
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another.	3.452540183727833
Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission ' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)	2.0398914839401843
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	2.0025039814129872
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	2.658222795219575
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.	3.0180151998013263
They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	2.542997491180563
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	2.1420723666607997
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	2.3981014848479063
The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy.	2.5214462803463324
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.	2.6012031340361186
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members ' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	2.9028561254879075
Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all.	2.064816902904281
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	2.4043522540075295
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	2.224662003218159
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	3.1444749085018273
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	1.9917590502793259
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.	1.465542063426791
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract.	1.6182134281482785
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	2.5908286265110174
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one.	2.787127149500215
One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area, for example and the United States, is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here.	2.534237921572625
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated, so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities: they are drawn by the bright lights, and the pubs, and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied.	1.6957069087810717
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.	2.300136954957567
(Parliament approved the joint text)	1.5047002582325815
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one ' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services.	2.2116825719356417
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	2.740783774536988
As a king sport fisherman myself, I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds.	1.7769764980050882
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	2.4360517288402344
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.	2.6756448145889644
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	2.2703339717008313
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.	2.585825799399925
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.	1.7615600060830292
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out.	2.295372790714273
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing.	1.3828910176844196
It must be a 'development round ' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included.	2.010358141337779
The United States ' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers ' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	2.8453593543012308
We belong together, even when there are problems.	2.817792577141679
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	2.007818011112323
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said.	2.4499725850809733
This is why I give this report my full support.	2.316324189370687
After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies.	2.0389827590016276
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	2.4175408731286097
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union.	2.125121044010655
. (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments?	2.5002750670910765
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	1.9890494081789563
As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy.	1.9346008178828686
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.	2.458917030752182
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done.	2.8056820168472107
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.	2.1707798963218274
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	3.0215934961918736
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.	2.800020739017568
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	2.1690580720404755
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	2.82570508804665
We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat.	2.2410196361887738
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	1.736479597321452
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.	2.472213202014883
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.	2.707247405315068
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.	1.5795566721016168
The approach that we have been following in these discussions, and our participation in them, essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist, based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate, and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found.	2.1919932833280327
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	2.830891388454723
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	2.06533578603263
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	2.1140879423819396
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	1.5540944303769562
Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy ' .	1.6265230503118882
As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities?	1.907746129532813
I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation.	2.7313483158193095
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	1.9900383888264537
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	1.4668766053717548
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	2.2282644044274535
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.	2.3960569659572153
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.	2.0863356713408248
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts".	2.3043435144951223
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.	2.2954703189751022
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.	2.3762243196912904
Moreover, these are factors which create employment.	1.9914987824376962
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency.	1.930316924749041
From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission.	2.5978197016094513
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.	2.2175554855017783
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	1.820122448519198
Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union ' s existence.	2.917921282539899
This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond.	2.0643188296050154
The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.	2.458037488125593
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.	2.816142714579716
By rejecting the rapporteur ' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.	2.026476396721905
Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.	2.3918274236692754
Are there any comments?	1.2644728256185398
Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.	2.472328725478971
And the merit of Mr Corrie ' s report is that it highlights the value of this original, proactive development instrument, together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly.	2.4326520261524727
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation.	2.375858098461766
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate, which all in all I have found to be encouraging and supportive, and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission.	2.898079597718733
In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions.	2.7267410785591375
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.	2.5070961781266994
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin ' s 'anti-terrorist ' operation in Chechnya.	1.365343982718647
In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.	2.932266320750985
That is transparency.	2.8206953488346924
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	2.33246316229976
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.	2.4005645019623905
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	1.909009066903213
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	2.7430426751568513
Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.	2.1744009831514712
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors.	2.203800453040224
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance.	3.071581888669632
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	2.1420968066665247
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	2.1255507790300814
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	1.746905080478258
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one.	2.9782665752324577
The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations.	2.0096524147999952
These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.	2.399115294469137
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during the Asian crisis in 1997, as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993, everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation, particularly currency speculation.	1.72182958262966
As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.	2.4804134898239214
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you.	2.7182850090213493
All workers in the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard.	2.2464424730233685
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member.	3.136113722896272
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	1.8729266121221821
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.	2.0864309898002333
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	2.0321275822794975
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	2.313843442259459
So it also has to do with environmental protection.	2.6913215455978015
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	2.819802490006304
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too, will certainly be both timely and welcome.	3.9025584025267293
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.	1.935887120120638
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	2.50258503946263
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.	2.172884072899226
We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.	2.390600641520021
Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use.	2.6437661046503207
Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons.	2.5264617770764475
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	2.5456841531635477
Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month.	1.7433564633907337
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	1.8405912412598222
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted.	2.2385734507394983
A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment.	1.7503416635924924
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.	2.3614893333542932
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	2.293739662787573
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	2.738466824742712
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	2.21820031392559
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	3.1034706597244073
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done.	2.4895274970886483
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.	2.6638519376187837
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	1.7285721994834424
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	2.189520774406184
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	2.351256322453754
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference.	3.2465153229796018
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	1.7669265187113037
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle.	2.416470823372473
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	2.0452396329273648
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.	2.7454973089383587
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	1.896275625909352
This is also true of development cooperation.	2.8358475964462095
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	2.135616673888183
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	2.7561383816774807
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.	2.2339968172057025
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.	2.1577668782042387
This is totally unacceptable.	3.041229575925888
Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	1.9201912786782043
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.	2.5678082848255914
I have good reason for asking this.	3.0716377947682743
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.	3.074160980474459
You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States.	2.401920455208843
Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission ' s programme.	2.145396434947624
Bankruptcy procedures	1.322338402406092
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.	1.8884393294532744
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.	2.1842314857958463
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here.	2.407032091637908
Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.	2.5132649500416755
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	1.8574905376103616
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	1.7949503081501015
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system.	2.558269993113327
On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note.	2.0010309791858387
Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union ' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole.	2.4796073055971073
Mr President, I too believe that tourism has a very important role to play, not just in our European regions, but throughout the world, because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development.	3.000347978098606
It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference.	3.106979941022316
In the capacity of coordinator of the European People ' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into.	2.412177362690328
This is a complete revolution of the Commission ' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.	2.6170410142813645
Modernising social protection	1.4119456821801966
I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support.	2.265137625105245
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.	2.3717330291475625
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	2.3052757733007674
We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise.	2.424313304361549
Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.	2.450106237804473
Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products.	2.0338054978577635
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	1.9255236630639267
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.	1.6997136275371751
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission ' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	2.276892968003635
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	2.1179728472390877
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	2.2320256189615684
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.	1.6598743839178365
In June of last year Europe 's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	2.1692427344856435
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers.	3.0835846124672264
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people ' s quality of life.	1.8559512409055339
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).	2.7109837269138812
Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon.	1.7539564977169009
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct.	1.9406456766177667
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.	1.9657019802254472
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices.	2.3076353537518823
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	2.8809112424360226
In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect.	3.0623729164067535
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	2.735647725629278
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.8266253287942256
On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society.	1.9907677817590432
.	1.374839594702952
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	2.554855428739071
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.	2.4908584836143155
A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets.	1.7597629502139964
Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter ' s content.	2.0059237438313904
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner.	2.5705043033365125
That is my judgement at the moment.	2.039573984973198
In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted.	1.8888104438069957
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	2.127101823300216
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer ' and the reply was 'a black grandmother ' .	1.8043640393805447
Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation.	2.0713606415209815
. (FR) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment, poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending.	1.9008643361693087
Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission ' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable.	2.598578469608264
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly.	2.5878314255911645
Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations?	1.9521442203657724
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	3.1524337359974672
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties.	2.4542943359812273
Do you think I am going over the top?	2.059270915787771
However, because of the Council ' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000.	2.3700570842077213
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle.	2.1745093918270526
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	2.351469267154356
The next item is the joint debate on:	2.0310858842941584
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	3.4230492537877075
We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations, which is a delicate and sensitive phase, by exploiting tensions.	2.134021160983429
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	2.069731378525047
The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending.	2.8852347935228027
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	2.0098923089741176
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if the world is turned upside down.	2.1044172357195126
We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates.	2.8172115222979697
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary.	2.3295314820892705
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.	2.167569017066664
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors.	2.346768778554917
The vote will take place at 12 noon.	2.3664818810414223
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	2.347407846580138
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.	2.4192404781259036
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	2.6812748850469896
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided.	2.4885806996268554
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party.	2.1594665136980042
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.	2.73283158703105
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.	2.643681006486036
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.	2.3394844127185053
On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred.	2.1135097579148567
This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone.	2.5370581271677306
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	2.872627332197884
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	2.2014247509919946
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	2.593345601395472
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	2.1922829258463636
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here.	2.818618178401709
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.	2.3371381446409005
Especially in the southern Member States, the tourist industry is a major source of income.	1.9853123749401917
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.	2.342072893181073
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.	2.3780986945309532
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.	2.847584926385772
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	2.515743599037896
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	2.0723150116518445
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.	3.4171936639480243
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	2.1484720266903508
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	2.4305825407709127
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.	2.317220215538979
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	1.8877817966160078
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.	2.066123087244361
Madam President, I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning.	2.121215598155401
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.	2.1192129263707176
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	2.5600011770975164
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.	2.8075605932193612
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.	3.1705535034344723
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?	2.397215174177527
We, however, second the Council ' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	2.1738375862039403
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.	3.2190410533222305
You must go further, towards reconciling the people with Europe, in particular those people who are falling victim to economic, social and, probably, in the future, technological divisions.	2.103844931546101
Madam President, I would simply like to point out that during the procedure, we were not allowed either to table or, consequently, adopt amendments in the Committee.	1.9885197941509702
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	1.5975826656973318
Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.	1.5786473455271
Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion.	2.0531840429818593
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	2.5622809730652665
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense.	2.9023200049563167
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	1.3703811213635868
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.	2.70267399279755
We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace.	2.3597693616541973
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	2.0026746075624833
It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union.	2.37235990268285
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.	2.2968741403650026
The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports.	2.041627495670688
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person.	2.2753170826748295
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union.	2.0960543857107004
As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept.	2.225506844398271
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.	1.7812548671338513
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard.	3.515498664784983
Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets.	2.0547550980377274
We need to open that debate.	2.6634025521304308
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	2.2032786071099904
Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey.	2.8923199476070653
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	2.906401955802559
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period.	2.8890566435309624
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.	2.3058264964816964
The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.	2.5589840433243616
This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution.	2.9290633872553977
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks?	2.283393102218361
If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!	2.391565225006828
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	3.2680302226144544
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	1.7691877998812402
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.	2.615878402336187
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	2.6522156082805495
I am disappointed in the EPP.	3.003916863432528
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.	2.236757651229001
In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	2.9838382082408685
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	2.56657013029985
That has never been the intention.	2.875618900119868
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	1.6788883174480824
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar ' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	2.217416946079883
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions.	2.423300175640597
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000 ' the programme of the citizen.	2.9170376477025073
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge.	2.5751594810077565
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	1.9988833047371688
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.8025257316374503
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.	2.48319955919868
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.	2.7853139125202953
That is important.	2.367875901986552
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	2.516353320810052
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	2.2727591970530105
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	2.2883881055330706
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	2.373404866046923
Neither is correct.	1.7409793572424983
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.	2.3996555361938734
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	2.4337195425806875
I have some sympathy with the Commission 's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally.	3.3356954056826367
Amendments Nos 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions.	1.4553018751917062
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.	1.955251012163075
Thus, whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour ' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same.	1.5321363166860993
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.	2.2944276116264217
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb.	2.523516681558148
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	1.4931875630802751
We want EQUAL to go ahead.	2.77488770384771
The polluter should pay.	3.6579026030201294
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks.	2.284056222162894
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations.	2.162216005048868
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.	1.7216138098323155
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	2.726910333634877
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.	2.90465893108891
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	2.507477632455108
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	2.33754770879046
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised.	2.8629511484149517
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	2.170380556708139
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.	2.42502180376691
The European Public Prosecutor ' s Office is nothing to be afraid of.	2.842401889905579
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	3.35843810894447
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	2.219957224343933
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	2.7087353189221575
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	1.7541990414277286
The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity.	2.289674635896142
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	2.102638730911796
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.	2.8023373408058663
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.	2.0273785292619797
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union ' s more remote areas.	2.796319460838139
The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now.	3.1608026154115354
The foul monster has been reawakened!	3.1102662814838045
We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly.	2.702428276909226
By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place.	1.7797768119850528
We need to cooperate with the Council too.	3.3416162117307078
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.	2.5517899018498453
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community ' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.	2.0277635812553036
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.	2.5399809341973842
We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent.	2.5880815772334054
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	2.4798032928202085
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States ' annual national plans for employment.	2.431212587013648
In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.	2.4286227383833925
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living.	2.0405875043036135
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code.	1.8299592896172958
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations.	2.008279103351199
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.	2.6598643228540757
Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission?	2.0627820782500432
I can perform this dual task.	2.8971968637039573
I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue.	2.5709061225647236
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	2.3142857434372486
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	2.483791855547095
The current situation is not good.	3.239176690515536
We have to lay down the rules of play today, before we all lose.	2.569855190011706
That is why we need transparency.	2.5377487809815475
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports.	2.0674419697642397
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.	2.1309268906068684
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	2.475149450851042
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier ' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	2.2360567064875845
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	1.1010991385448057
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	2.8081318259572883
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.	2.5189495064825422
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.	3.7051138758328754
I will willingly accept Madam President ' s apologies any time.	2.3309785119529534
Reform of European competition policy	1.7995287345899067
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	2.3941933196911727
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement.	2.8471158832798333
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector.	2.5853000526262098
Now who should pay the costs?	2.2451699924682904
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	1.9305587258073977
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	2.498548142858355
It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives.	2.0631385959938626
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your valuable contribution to this Question Time.	1.7584334492655087
It was very small.	3.3350762717531452
It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating.	2.33156219262817
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.	2.129522767007906
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty.	2.180757999740465
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can, in a few hours, cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country, plunging its whole population into recession.	1.9069801818640981
Thank you for your answer.	2.1603940759447964
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	2.552843848253597
Mr President, during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was pleasantly surprised.	2.2003743760684493
Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe.	2.512370522653591
Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries.	1.9818724432693806
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	2.185763598980124
In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed.	2.5348700205292682
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.	1.993754188614884
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.	2.4222421803567356
However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now.	2.1991061716848717
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.	2.5465354166295064
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	2.1981764584829135
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	2.7465251554777566
The Council ' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling.	2.622200990080788
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	1.9223556956472134
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.	2.6763734869196236
In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.	2.064154695660728
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.	1.9587351167896456
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections.	2.1590760360769914
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.	2.3614585790469595
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.	2.3351337721578633
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission ' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.	3.9665408153325785
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	2.22534863341356
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	2.407666992404555
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.	1.9419424613947314
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	2.487263838005968
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position.	2.0113740410231595
This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability.	2.2105502343121595
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	2.7034848905646838
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.	2.3803796877617733
During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon.	2.36092250282567
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.	2.1894179500127144
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	1.7635270172230724
However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources.	2.729344375716449
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?	1.6387688189204865
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.	2.473166208582099
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe?	1.7636999165899132
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	2.31579177233784
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	2.279046290815697
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10.	1.6119782512019074
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.	1.9084435871713108
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here?	1.9813015791011281
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.	2.0140002095519502
	1.0510108151299706
Subject: Commission 's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue '.	2.38029296023453
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?	2.5229712146664345
I know that action is being taken against this so-called tourism elsewhere, but we must remember the European Union ' s responsibility at this level.	2.715392346963001
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	2.202935279839347
Question Time (Commission)	1.8469571105543827
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	2.6766464721571426
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	2.2324480604402734
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	1.8559341085014511
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.	2.2034988649347858
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector.	1.7378499911234628
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.	2.3312313944358274
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva.	2.7226694983668502
Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses.	1.8454076933661627
Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	2.2130358458363744
Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe.	1.9816558829628752
Have the lessons not been learnt?	1.72698529033285
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.	2.258639701896233
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	2.393033902662999
That is how the common position has been worded.	2.995271263595574
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees.	2.8029086089758297
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.	2.641952764978262
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else.	1.8250936515710052
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.	1.875315800616377
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	2.0733652717735387
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	2.8770283323304913
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	2.1735316962319016
Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago.	2.025167276819878
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed.	2.1694197340955372
The nations, regions, towns and communities of Europe will be preserved.	2.704212922538482
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability, as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us, is the result of speculation.	2.142514641293643
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	3.216165647808806
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.	2.3292871984515826
Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament.	2.2379992579936503
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.	2.655034609869237
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner.	2.3579014708853534
However, we must be realistic.	2.9576809170774228
If Mr Katiforis ' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched.	2.289235782486293
Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union.	2.286555151275791
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	2.0363798270014275
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings.	2.953447927960463
Here, Mrs Lienemann, Mr President, we are putting forward here a practical proposal, a common sense proposal, easy to implement, likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies, before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40%!	1.771739574600567
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman 's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	2.5870482428785553
This applies both to the post and other sectors.	2.6482715409429343
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU.	2.010664309006839
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	2.5131598139374822
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC. This is in the special interest of northern European regions.	2.0935357167674695
I agree with Parliament that the common position ' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced.	2.4899645964169945
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.	2.0095213707128887
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.	1.9594731034615638
As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty.	2.6787270645654386
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.	2.4711345353850946
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	2.449706866816125
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.	2.4314477240538426
There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand.	1.9753807235812066
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	3.343884751881472
The term 'legale esterno ' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre ' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre ' is.	2.121478885270085
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	2.4085338180203344
It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another.	2.0436883939315
It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace.	2.103948197977386
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.	2.7108304029893766
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital.	2.0776112407113394
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.	1.7894333671261704
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery.	2.425574574576831
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	2.708530911728983
Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide.	1.8384717821927405
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	3.5253358248486717
The world ' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	2.0799032126466095
So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources.	2.419005930684896
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for their constructive approach.	2.117109058533722
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day.	2.689207850781873
These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities.	2.1930930498248182
In itself, globalisation is positive.	2.9388759963182673
Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid.	1.563286681320802
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	2.6552694806890367
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner ' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover.	2.170815910832299
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	2.8315437656594966
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	2.0542710098040313
The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters.	1.9911142460998448
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	2.901081994193867
Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars.	2.0718427463535396
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	1.8810972185475034
I recommend the report to the House.	3.4256314580523197
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	2.2837690852476973
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	2.56471051025459
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role.	2.501616507389613
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	2.108392058025135
The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water.	2.4202375029242207
Congratulations!	1.3212462187361116
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue?	2.158237948173484
A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country ' s fishing industry.	2.3536052891533004
Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created.	2.6973581177411257
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	2.265098345616694
In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens.	2.484361053037674
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	2.3289644659083186
The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued, non tourist areas, which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments.	2.0474960201667334
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.	2.102817231555916
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	2.851307979592174
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.	2.0406467359607112
In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions.	2.13810052763593
Firstly, we need to make the EU ' s development policy more effective.	3.08064407280234
On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.	1.8787491999793333
It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU.	2.1705535717484974
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	1.9125153020089258
Why would it not work elsewhere?	2.1547421793635406
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	2.4885996608471594
Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union ' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage.	2.1110604576798906
I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity.	2.3116205159120407
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.	2.18820496845709
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.	1.7842605924425816
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.	1.9909810631094633
Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.	3.0051702833230833
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	2.482411605154397
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet ' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.	2.1406796647385744
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.	2.1487369070825975
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	3.2822852406889864
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.	2.560871153302815
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	2.50245667735964
We disagree with many of the report ' s views.	3.7008446299762627
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.	1.7410823441606487
This proposal can therefore be approved.	2.8804565672908495
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	3.1008813630916787
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted.	2.4826237602393655
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society.	1.8140985656586006
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House.	1.9875979417195162
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity.	2.5489394779621954
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	2.1368117564568836
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty ' s treatment of the right of reproduction.	2.2896027377944823
We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties.	2.5192276825940203
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this, I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government.	2.321205879555361
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission ' s and the Council ' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?	3.6857894456060976
As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.	1.805973662822935
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.	2.1515200796444227
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline, I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000, as set in the common position - must now be moved forward.	2.2377054101514955
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	2.3843425355356516
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	2.8765383583518136
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	2.409211338197326
But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	1.8853589253808394
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	2.6311783149547914
To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.	3.0964097275757427
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.	2.282338552491016
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.	2.035050713890943
We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment.	1.9383158924172992
One of the reasons for the Community ' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment.	1.9535568016195037
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.	2.7928645582608884
Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment.	1.5044096857018812
The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	2.448831425451549
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data.	2.3296860145930913
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	1.8728870430279176
This event must underpin enlargement.	2.939526784145984
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	1.5679846481138
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.	2.5053825522852
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon.	2.462485538749728
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.	2.4635234208671326
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	2.4807682553092985
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	2.517415977099146
No.	1.5440407263470464
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers.	2.4277637437565427
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.	2.1998023675412446
Helicopters are therefore needed.	1.3425569655038334
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.	2.198797400824325
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture.	2.8628858991202617
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	2.1775129283154846
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	1.8462011386661026
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms.	1.6580376287078271
Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security.	1.48781698748098
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	2.2107782958739266
This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104.	1.843291081443435
However, we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government.	2.3732342202355228
In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff.	2.8918175534078903
I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors.	2.4451116867165674
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	2.5922979892374873
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	2.363160672148765
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders.	2.208868126952307
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	1.5500116694380346
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.	2.5163507346472755
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	2.2007045952170645
The European Union must take the initiative and must also, as demanded in the motion, propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.	2.5240156610122684
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency ' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	2.326591849638098
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.	2.723398171453156
The polluter ought to pay.	3.292645908431789
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	2.3632098737204523
I can speak for my party, which championed Austria ' s membership of the European Union in the early days.	2.8437220902228577
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation.	2.5985891098805842
In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later.	2.3948934720281327
As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton ' s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead.	1.8435238015001645
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	2.560321078039252
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office.	2.138028976669612
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.4508850366397787
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	1.9573529342709355
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	2.014735310142266
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.	2.500765747842928
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.	2.5817001227193046
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons.	2.761345066454618
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	2.565854504628806
Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing.	2.0837635123479643
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.	2.710639480208395
A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	2.3076650781280006
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.	2.6077679992584226
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	1.9987985388023135
This time, however, it is true.	3.3778951780092843
.	1.374839594702952
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000.	2.3903866366354345
This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.1333908302961757
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty.	2.4004723856828822
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.	2.6927991734718795
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU.	2.05653312528829
From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider.	1.933969687606795
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.	3.1543775131775513
Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry.	2.090436796111572
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.	2.2834599940043976
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner.	2.664786324662789
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.	1.8202701578767682
Let me give you three examples.	2.053989951582828
The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance.	2.2895236373045953
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.	2.71383417682042
Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	1.7733406809791485
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.	1.676570296062513
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action.	2.143360284215855
We think there are other positive advances too.	2.9268694073072212
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.	2.6168234438274216
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	2.2169763238156137
Will you confirm what is the case?	2.2441290845980815
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	2.8384413671642243
This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO ' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	3.12555242185557
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	1.5501012859179293
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	2.7073972371203747
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.	2.480837958154194
This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary.	2.5329715190611135
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.	2.0862360836757783
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):	1.821514484737527
That would not be a good thing.	3.9717018822269012
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development.	2.36985860503872
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	2.3280771704257734
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur.	2.6751390287630765
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.	2.185476745014886
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation.	2.0343272192808515
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union ' s Member States.	2.9778651300551147
Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council.	2.5552194355899247
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	2.3457785794462427
Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members.	2.3385206534092156
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.	2.2835975743183923
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	2.181151870684854
Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.	1.5682547139494303
However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint.	2.2327344111235337
Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement.	2.0223239332744205
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.	2.041590803938066
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	2.7605623254003993
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic ' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.	2.541653576936822
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.	1.8815570153654386
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	2.1927477572484437
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.	2.163134947381582
I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules.	2.0804826772120726
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms.	2.18424218488324
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.	2.3800139575957626
Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community ' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement.	2.0838857723812323
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate.	2.3687695736000083
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.	2.137929776243946
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.	1.574467071341174
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.	2.9023185283282493
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice.	2.1652952319589263
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment.	2.649970100002062
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	3.3278988176238653
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations.	2.6612925624598396
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.	2.060048434284012
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	1.883608236881539
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event.	1.5037787551584498
Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures.	1.8059828029960054
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors.	2.8682055755928695
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	2.3942528868771875
I now come to the content of the report.	2.8786223817053935
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	2.5556382598988727
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.	2.242526237692897
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development, in particular based on local traditions, techniques and practices, on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy.	2.005658638325811
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];	1.6941829968065727
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.	1.653848639371243
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard.	2.7265271171208725
Apparently, according to my information, the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work.	1.5853594273159743
The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective.	2.4458773559608114
The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be.	2.6119470256844854
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	2.6014362681655396
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!	1.8594515291438687
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.	1.9001650942115351
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.	2.281690781745083
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	2.4134011769982138
Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies.	2.286261594288763
We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner ' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique.	2.6172927324097164
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	2.7305712436219802
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors.	2.601410770144447
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large.	2.3540661289111053
- (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.	1.8440846489669422
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.	1.8604619091129606
I will mention two point that may create tension.	2.507892868774822
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.	2.095924118057963
Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent.	2.1313944998073913
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.	1.7971003654178386
These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.	2.2155502044440594
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.	2.4381356320878425
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.	3.62072305975428
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	2.332552836606367
It is the Member States ' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	2.62159733045613
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	2.6380814608283187
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	2.2650559468848868
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	2.815289307166638
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	2.5780102658635844
As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee.	1.9482395395344942
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	1.9147626196553926
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	2.569993807431364
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.	2.820143965558513
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means.	2.715288364492815
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	1.5454900095009023
But we shall have a decision very soon.	2.593865044780226
The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance.	2.7231663727746813
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.	1.9152845464115724
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age.	2.7079227029018766
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives.	2.3256711006969906
For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.	1.926777299571211
Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable.	1.7346949383220573
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.	2.470308781973834
Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda.	2.9021998111139076
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	2.007072828623169
However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy.	2.5175887541221167
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report.	2.204377621458505
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.	2.572259222708877
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation.	1.5854413232760796
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	2.610210223443497
However, since state aid forms the lion ' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer ' s report, to say one more thing about it.	1.9484651668729749
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.	2.31885895593032
Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union.	2.519183320575846
In Finland surface waters are very clean.	2.6701830028931566
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?	1.953364807921081
. I welcome Mr Brok ' s report supporting with amendments the Commission ' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.	2.522076068717508
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.	2.2033839814430287
Mr President, the Commission ' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	2.2765629858708056
Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations.	1.8988606198453977
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	2.662428166820421
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	2.1486743029345994
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	2.0472021188660485
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.	2.4694853865021162
That is absolutely crucial.	2.6436131225437376
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	2.5092392871367295
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council ' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament ' s reading of it.	2.44051937699766
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.	2.0190865220804315
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU.	2.1449357062718226
We could not agree more with the latter.	2.5030141915516615
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	2.140672893376284
There are two approaches.	2.607940155417711
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	2.3212607546796566
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council.	2.5403259660489814
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey 's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	1.333992877237408
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.	2.4104017443402563
The FPÖ party is established in Austria ' s political landscape.	3.249854837348948
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is.	2.7192280731138805
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	1.8342430266062513
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.	2.359769645456919
The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS).	1.920004660560366
This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem.	3.860924469770794
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola.	2.776201400466487
There should be no confusion in this debate. As environmentalists, we do not want an excuse for a motion.	2.56653639618629
Already stretched resources are being further stretched.	1.6966390320287992
The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field.	1.8982304429610364
However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future.	2.081659632921572
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique.	2.484094574075606
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.	2.7062844835617272
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.	2.544734139866299
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	3.335554714631733
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch.	2.059614298448725
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	2.5360462190873196
- (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no.	1.8378012538818178
The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever.	2.3390308266233606
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider.	1.7498248512961962
The Commission 's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.	2.537977707933357
Such policy should comprise various components.	1.8738382009115109
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.	2.382772686979092
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin.	2.5337603992673254
Conditions are ripe.	1.2916249002854552
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period.	3.311342834126061
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future.	2.886934609265803
As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation.	2.544358253904981
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted.	2.320955855625797
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.	2.084528966609155
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth ' s sake.	2.6542091812642186
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.	1.851681739970325
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature.	2.1923188866415835
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.	3.255863318472539
Still on the subject of Wednesday ' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	1.8999123230383055
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.	2.292710162098875
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	3.2466508841309643
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	1.8559341085014511
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	2.1223907589686277
If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020.	2.5210510480163713
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU ' s next round of enlargement.	1.8747361091388681
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets.	1.7168820584231244
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	2.064299119386467
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.	2.3193719739511462
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective.	2.7147748356835497
Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy?	2.1590964055050526
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them.	1.7453468972108308
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.	2.2619936836731105
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application.	2.4498628303257775
In response I can only say that this already exists.	3.068878093330855
Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further.	4.08292692082287
On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion.	2.4113790080571507
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.	4.511050420899742
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.	2.484111137410586
This seems to me to be a workable solution.	3.778193059593711
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.	2.4192214976789583
Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint.	1.6082814129365173
This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general.	2.291456578844787
Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China.	2.179686257414033
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.	2.419576069736716
Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President.	2.059294871924474
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.	1.9834701522681326
They are political because we are moving on.	2.6071822252741006
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.	2.4046201618994036
The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions.	2.4480408051074805
Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure.	3.410555835754082
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.	2.0628606532539475
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	2.157376685857298
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	2.279511521966436
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right.	1.956019562564383
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	1.7564831105270258
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.	2.746032926374822
I also want to take up the subject of migration.	3.694024213640465
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings.	2.2662317858846843
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	2.212253176352032
The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion.	2.5622853381255437
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	2.351438661260537
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card.	2.5830513003535636
It is time we stopped this trend.	2.549683427752622
We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.	2.34549132473315
As for the monitoring and management of these programmes, I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation.	2.8116594494346803
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector.	2.648119185747725
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	3.0036141548426705
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside ' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside ' s basic social and economic branch.	2.136043958132899
Despite these objections of mine to the Council ' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.	2.43990370386015
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time!	2.4118255890564733
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service.	2.30453593759814
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence.	1.8214163131827323
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable.	1.2684109914157466
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	2.4692059239979565
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE.	3.021673594767738
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	2.166453823351818
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	1.982766204088898
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.	3.7235192464398126
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	2.4512381351163213
Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU.	1.9078799750351938
Mr President, permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel, who is a member of the ÖVP executive, that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider, and that we wish to denounce you for doing so!	2.193139914473228
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.	1.6415617735543737
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	2.183766599331624
Is this too much of a burden?	2.198772464265623
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.	2.1656122596867724
EQUAL stands for "equality" .	1.5563702059661897
I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed.	2.0832022722449244
Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed.	2.2009882417111584
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.	1.501396528523256
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	2.6411328809042365
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	2.5837744788528094
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	1.8221599947475744
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.	1.9259537718668174
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	2.290338498358891
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	2.4675221233448554
We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria.	2.6076605653540352
This is not the Union ' s only contribution.	3.6336198021868347
Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.	1.861380513345035
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.	2.1141275589980792
As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika.	2.623591724025711
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?	2.7644098139315627
FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right.	1.9191803271679042
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	2.4492659060253748
We would like to know their names and their faces.	3.0309864118162757
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	2.540232456482884
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People ' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People ' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí ' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice.	2.527405495923033
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	2.130655163388416
However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca ' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.	2.0215717451201662
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.	2.5720868144798783
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.	2.6766055485857425
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	1.746585283178905
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred.	1.9442532618476867
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	2.1878777597501515
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.	2.4387594675936826
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.	2.4203422249892395
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	2.058091442240378
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?	2.9785293372852277
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution.	1.964693873188017
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	1.8448620165869518
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	3.2798599322384496
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	2.3266775807046187
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.	1.832698033140739
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	2.2671198039209295
We must improve information on all of the world ' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	2.4882907613179936
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	2.639666853387629
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	2.6493907622659236
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	2.7238679232949994
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	2.9835910911137242
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.	2.2582630296639445
Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed.	2.5272968817158517
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	2.2341565488356157
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	2.20116297182525
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	2.3552268306864432
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO ' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO ' s action.	2.342628954945106
In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed.	2.0845506327939285
In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm.	2.2599739315616136
Counterfeiting is not on the list.	1.4306601985078728
With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.	2.170406277562227
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	1.7924837885732192
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth ' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation.	2.0861135908842607
We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment.	2.596484574243776
That needs to be addressed.	3.52362224528454
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing.	2.6705272303877727
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.	2.2019410162129063
That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken.	2.0512426280859994
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?	2.688465247255617
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so.	2.397284688057092
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe ' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.593192494172938
Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade.	3.133251019078083
Currently, both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.	1.652118643777032
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	2.2288236983171643
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.	1.9627652561809679
What is the result?	2.425266654497606
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.	2.4454179341031925
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	3.65556471084033
The second point is human resources.	2.8476941315949995
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors.	3.158174737790961
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	2.4171785929973195
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	2.3058448782772434
Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport.	1.8579146830155406
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays ' principle.	2.420983174221876
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.	2.6493568473827804
Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time.	1.455194703483688
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission ' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy.	2.3857444814263347
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.	2.472462516749348
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community ' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.	2.2755342077344105
That it is what we are doing.	3.111584631769624
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.	1.7980563484544452
Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol.	1.8297896320525515
As the French say, "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l 'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community ' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.	2.1246093873276224
This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia ' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend.	2.7085687944235524
However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected.	2.4775487935096923
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned.	2.249803366193756
In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	2.267100140806129
When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market, we must also deal with the darker side, namely bankruptcies.	2.6421681948462665
I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union ' s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.	2.8188637732354076
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997.	2.215394903879493
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	2.559036746262111
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	2.0619354631944136
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment.	1.9036217635193395
It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU.	2.654002143118734
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.	2.3708175843095076
Why?	1.3212462187361116
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.	3.270868824745058
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation.	2.420317936355144
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	2.2271496743482615
Well, they see the planet 's resources being unevenly spread.	1.7101809979743707
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials.	2.0091249464980527
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	2.2742085571371806
I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.	2.5815998837143166
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	2.333328275661438
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas.	2.1601339126696115
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission ' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	2.5964626736387526
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	2.780535583564547
You can see it in different countries.	2.2620103304002637
Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)	1.8575912353438686
I, together with the European Parliament ' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council ' s Legal Service, is inappropriate.	2.711410896740324
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	2.3100730210238596
It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute.	2.508249539384025
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	2.351304002808994
There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment.	1.8473421434536885
I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	3.148171580806699
This is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery, a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament, led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives.	1.9403705368335378
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	2.8193534721476254
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	2.000501833298872
It does, however, support my view that I am not, apparently, the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion.	2.7602558028669053
Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community ' s environmental policy.	2.9302860980954515
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.	2.731598331392688
We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests.	2.7930016544494425
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)	1.5540944303769562
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010.	2.6698104714850364
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries.	2.436783320816468
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms ' and 'structures ' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.	1.9479614600267765
The Commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	2.8577747066159183
Not at all.	2.0612690445859934
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	2.0670832796679646
What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.	2.506894945149101
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.	2.684903768922188
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	2.553141670187937
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months ' time.	2.0401722884236944
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union 's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	2.6525236692773126
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?	2.5147776818563603
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.	2.473845310590502
(FR) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for a "constitutional process to be launched" .	2.3475240494881895
Most of the report is about financial control.	2.4782898385183234
I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period "before" and "after" NATO ' s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time.	1.9221108687256867
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries ' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.	2.000035143706434
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	2.2622343566855445
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	2.4914600681778496
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	2.9755663611614707
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House.	2.4148248603033275
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	1.808517985668207
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	2.739950139506888
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.	1.8667841715140274
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy.	2.488193783848234
.	1.374839594702952
Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.	1.9347933853582004
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.	2.1032091051627004
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process.	2.63287752681033
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.	3.135713034296066
And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees.	1.7396256762612288
the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Commission, on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax.	2.174118977759953
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	3.4052338992609306
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	2.0462446785004333
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty.	2.174979185997371
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.	2.563287179512373
I therefore hope, firstly, that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other.	2.7514891529800436
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country ' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice.	2.0595204171880224
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	2.1091729998361277
Thirdly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive.	2.593562048366097
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.	2.257577565363746
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):	1.7571402537602248
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC.	2.263903640623573
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.	2.1062845087534323
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with.	1.8408283315646488
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States ' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases.	2.0258345704479104
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	2.220872669886862
Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s.	1.75101487994464
Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned.	2.1822465701755447
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union ' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.	2.361823583269107
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	3.028638510079906
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	2.647957798770352
It is a very extensive report.	3.28976045591686
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	3.305697940190419
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by.	2.11064222005615
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	1.7412538598291996
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	2.4342421543424804
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.	2.0177554294834668
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	2.230056299126262
UCITS	1.5582622359257436
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year.	2.5880676963601776
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	4.1070541120278365
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	3.225358906338816
Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many.	1.7533967063575018
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority.	2.13709550751383
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	1.9697552956689215
An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.	2.2664659808298815
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor.	2.6503649380329763
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF ' s work your full support, also in its present form.	2.283722714353073
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.	1.9805513903536374
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.	2.7157699268788535
Thank you very much Commissioner.	2.0218832873977464
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	1.7430931614302358
An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view.	1.6144313565757746
If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up.	2.3533418610669132
Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich, so much so that it became difficult to gather, i.e. to put those decisions into practice.	1.898479980161241
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.	2.349577248210619
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.	2.3334336181744573
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	2.4486887067934227
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north?	1.7163184902213597
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.	1.8164455207929886
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	2.3572090489785222
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.	2.256716144147139
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	1.6285569374054196
And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets.	2.68467460205872
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain.	2.1284490483783807
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.	2.2727185839553123
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.	2.3294841204961876
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict.	2.078734004261718
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	2.1459635081184487
Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings.	1.4763296074763992
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.	1.6149697522121014
Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money.	1.9674296336733794
A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	2.53277553134186
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.	1.8046057306526722
A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS).	1.8375719018318046
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.	2.179649084363426
I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom.	2.320041106213547
The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament.	3.637047616820469
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House.	2.5885470999039466
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted.	3.763907289629537
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament 's Committee on the Environment and the Council.	2.3930689681925603
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	2.2158784978487436
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union ' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants ' incomes.	2.1997097065531013
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	1.6678921482064224
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	1.597726105250082
On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki.	1.6828914182813837
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	2.171221424730252
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?	1.6961893486076753
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment.	2.6484768735292032
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully.	3.300290266866398
Recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Ms Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (11221/1999 - COM(1998) 249 - C5 - 0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)	1.7688327802106678
Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict.	2.1337628343029063
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	2.389411662517532
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.	2.2058441533108093
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE.	2.7696407151586655
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.	2.2776570510853387
However, that is not the problem.	3.7513923939682936
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	1.7820711622291077
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	2.26954545606555
Equality has no pillar of its own.	1.497265942527973
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	2.4736671538594797
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.	2.529150590810425
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002.	2.168248566205568
Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland.	2.2211750609220062
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.	1.6179585942304782
Does that not say a lot about management ability?	2.164495506604369
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	2.237066621138304
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	1.8948257712107883
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	2.1974926126599152
By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine.	1.875479510424486
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays.	2.7428817707549755
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria.	1.2979704804514178
These were essentially of three types which I will describe.	2.2602739758505312
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building.	2.979216513069239
I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time.	2.8588133527693267
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission ' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	2.6034346660802274
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste.	1.7347665806450099
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	2.475482398914844
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision.	2.1142074750737496
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity.	2.5746255982903947
It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.	2.5405264006470025
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations.	2.7856373015221703
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	2.5355329618134856
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.	2.019088614528294
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union.	2.429541837394014
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	2.420431744991988
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.	1.7032915756614881
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions.	2.2324552398210247
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999.	1.9170264622401791
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age.	1.8459730315223115
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	2.1334491053451488
If not, why not?	2.176986471645928
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan.	2.043801794502428
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	2.3005744831009043
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	2.1066622378387603
I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House.	2.218202012471138
We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.	2.525235176525783
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	1.729057811546934
The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.	2.4409026818174486
That is a more reasonable system.	2.468427459153116
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	2.3806444694020246
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	3.208185265332969
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.	2.4119140268575916
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.	2.524449646902712
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations.	1.9013712812852506
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use, including taxes, in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them.	1.8683731220856283
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	2.2914930447769346
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	1.9250115121496645
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	2.246257195707761
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	2.2271607008820467
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	2.3855755022052603
I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House.	2.5699771842982653
In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia.	1.8551312006061906
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.	2.347883946704509
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints.	3.1432293762324868
I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised.	2.272073194919764
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads ' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	2.14525675447828
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.	1.5998950906183547
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	1.8687309032871742
This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future.	2.538665881500451
I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.	2.1525727018132192
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	2.0034884228749688
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	2.468298473123903
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community.	2.2511520385617145
As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected.	2.141992538713648
Let me illustrate this with a topical example.	1.9961194093722376
Everyone is free to hold such views.	1.615831605062875
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.	2.2382155179315126
In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made.	2.4202113421162244
An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries.	2.031661743743134
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	2.836115202099777
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	2.27936115396677
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	2.127210947852489
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	2.570051566374156
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	1.8105094189097004
I am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high-level working group report, your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy.	2.865845745388558
Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric.	2.4590776731782586
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	2.08341722145178
Mr President, Mrs Attwooll ' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002.	2.780414042641826
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	1.7384253118398871
Five months are provided for this.	1.48530292558858
In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.	2.1985682461138913
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	2.7905057804981412
As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably.	3.23218093577721
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past.	2.523232436262071
However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	2.3319029979463726
An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity.	1.8366860576927213
Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included.	2.247948436835468
We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament ' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.	2.3255777191012346
The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean.	2.613334165655982
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	2.3693702963108043
There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment.	2.3014059371861486
It is something that we can all support.	4.050652867977722
As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector.	2.3704116579481562
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	2.3074977756377266
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.	1.9478637306059774
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	3.5055848150439393
The Austrian People ' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.	2.3980077536638653
. (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.	2.515051751990094
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.	2.0327369134813327
It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous.	1.990570379798057
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.	1.682004468574815
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.	2.54878835768434
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	2.282147640469737
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to.	1.8691788831624547
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	1.8421522724267438
I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water.	3.3896075199659648
Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal.	2.0731755287268907
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6.	2.1820808986049336
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe.	1.7961874180733588
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	2.109136810905756
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.	1.9374471957858066
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	2.0201269982824552
Rather, the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me.	1.598250650988993
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.	1.482238631130425
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	2.2074857107936072
In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village.	2.22981689152497
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version.	2.5389932807824334
The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia.	2.1662878134916914
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	1.9362576399562812
The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future.	2.411777883335182
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.	2.065569365030747
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women ' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.	2.6017888245412877
Subject: Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament.	3.3080559418394304
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.	2.3600337115120626
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on.	2.601874934740413
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material.	2.339110034942589
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.	2.3940591198389085
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.	2.9017257302407877
If the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.	1.9249366419115053
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	1.8134732612346314
Mr President, the Commission 's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved.	2.6490475809085927
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe.	1.83111097157558
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	2.2144511643917717
We therefore welcome the Commission ' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.	3.071566454408735
The real culprits are Austria ' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	1.9919423098790061
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.	2.358049739224875
Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model ' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone.	2.014406961763467
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service.	4.812515329935424
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	3.010230993563127
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations.	2.471973226128335
Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States.	2.1549297268242675
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.	1.8688893422987298
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	2.662224494354812
Thank you for the follow-up question.	2.2450482683783797
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	3.1458616628525693
The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº.	2.2031319149585467
The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat.	2.298222102150724
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.	2.123881713405495
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.	2.29920764355721
a) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday:	1.3316661869377135
Does the Council consider that, on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty, national legislation on transparency can be regulated, that is to say legislation not relating to the EU ' s institutions?	2.354916328895518
When I read the report and see the picture of the EU ' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture.	2.6438863332878872
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	2.1076718577217832
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	2.265187854583787
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?	1.5957124253901123
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable.	2.2421452175063235
No, of course not.	1.8540772460815251
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia ' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000.	2.0333638850289595
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	2.939093888241517
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	2.272295395413203
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	2.366859297699342
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	2.4106158692250235
One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under.	2.1902186278535303
Proposal for a joint resolution on the Commission ' s 5 year Strategic Programme	2.125954133577662
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States.	2.388488490858947
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities.	2.7095798752221576
For us, the Group of the European People ' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years.	2.937817915774351
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason.	1.9989219295477045
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report.	2.2724712904667124
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	2.7137197295382776
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	2.4973421413372763
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.	1.6138233252231158
.	1.374839594702952
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union ' s rural development policy.	2.4489708989011487
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	2.1521186817270768
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water.	2.443199802228991
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it.	1.9340277600166986
We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency ' s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme.	3.235453353565136
Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro?	2.707014243548647
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.	2.533413809534077
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	1.7409787091954123
Mr President, the Group of the European People ' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	2.7893083660853484
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.	2.4150287383465123
In common with Mrs McCarthy, I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced.	2.954327613541893
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	2.357666018006103
We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.	2.437489244138314
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	3.0173255500477465
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	2.765112485530212
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	2.491230318634218
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion.	2.1186908825242163
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions".	1.9308864856605301
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission ' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	2.763620230611238
The common fisheries policy is not working.	3.65473762211426
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	2.3107976073018195
Note that this proposed tax, which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people, would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation. Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere.	1.9482631901615497
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	2.299776812576638
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.	2.4870071176589152
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	2.667846195571783
While Commissioner Patten ' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	1.9967021292314147
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	3.1514005383053076
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	1.7262525153782073
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious.	2.5848511247496804
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?	2.428813390057071
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	2.5000319409140594
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	2.425799929697681
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	2.322107913975982
I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.	2.5361186643673586
Mr President, I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair, in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative.	2.358699434544042
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland ' s only Objective I region.	2.2707518918903613
Mr President, you are a symbol of these changes.	2.6659016931190376
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive.	2.980986689482561
The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union.	3.6633602570239776
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	1.9331298114142668
The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data.	2.818408554261499
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?	2.0500358473104408
A drop in standards should not be allowed.	2.483492984601349
So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review.	2.7517081102442282
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.	2.5830750626879935
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	2.0345247767416352
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	2.1692522377655092
Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota?	1.7306808286559414
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty.	2.751084943626276
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.	2.9187307827109334
We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament.	2.0836223150328697
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.	2.8369972365311744
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.	2.326856691349979
It is the international community, and specifically the United Nations, which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and, in particular, for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality.	2.4488454731047984
That is excellent news!	2.625409268055162
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.	2.3161462228707372
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	1.9865171026456436
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission ' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level.	2.8504359188261392
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?	2.5001723235264546
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	2.073966454688395
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.	1.580658806324417
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission.	2.813644339371545
This has a certain semiological value because the Mediterranean and its islands - and I too come from an island - are the area which most of those who come from northern Europe for their summer holidays get to see, as well as the people who live there.	2.3637758341744726
What are the Council 's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	1.81176651923714
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.	1.9656102350311182
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.	2.89723817138057
But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.	1.8787179858501364
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	1.9776323448003463
Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established.	1.9115562842745484
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	1.3767940569722776
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights.	1.96085129343918
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future.	2.248325599444696
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	2.221152666879719
I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities, the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports.	2.307530724481926
This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained.	2.578033742813705
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this.	2.488193228626102
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	2.9948806400260533
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.	2.552775886899257
Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union.	2.2114069107095293
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities, we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women, mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments, and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations, social solidarity.	1.9914410326892609
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed.	2.396240574619873
Mr Di Pietro ' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	2.134455140977092
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	2.673376627194036
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can ' t have it all. '	1.7957563031274746
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence.	2.953287546292196
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	2.0550795292312856
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce.	3.5625130595335923
Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?	1.6207813534639945
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	2.826396214874379
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	2.0707553155742215
Mrs Lucas should do the same.	1.9560026303845317
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	2.315973659869747
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.	2.5685482613517063
We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures.	2.0648665501353887
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	2.719576510481203
Who will provide us with new jobs?	1.8660525598242903
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.	1.9111217545289667
A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens ' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past.	2.155942189807775
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia?	1.9909350403829633
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.	2.3921142668646627
There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report.	2.595122779760219
We are to know when they meet.	2.654655313954919
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities.	2.00682921623762
Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.	2.0721295246472735
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before.	2.668668547104926
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence.	2.318039900134099
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	3.5112408594390945
As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected.	2.2019587298233723
The discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments. The first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the European Union and the north of the island, without this necessarily signifying recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level, but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island, if a solution can, in the meantime, be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island.	2.325954014791592
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support.	2.5010785360816192
Flora Brovina ' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.	1.4668007219247126
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre.	1.8965856930335883
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	1.894919739003141
Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty.	2.593391276082454
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	2.7547974761357867
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.	2.5120554618744304
Subject: Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership, involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies, the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding, monitoring and assessment of the measures taken.	2.2051231994633853
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	1.97113775084039
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States ' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	2.706309166392307
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	2.6616310202101934
It is an excellent report.	2.9388136701435292
. Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development.	2.444764902402916
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	2.1553047595941903
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004.	1.8130254743675072
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	1.5580112171784855
This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments.	2.26711458488694
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	2.6457305840443217
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	2.322406198096686
Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these.	1.8510673290630513
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what ' but more 'what are we doing together ' ?	2.009166610930718
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale ' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	1.8037549550476208
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	2.0784896471750463
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission ' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field.	2.757395529194668
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction, in its December conclusions, at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission, which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal, together with similar contributions made by Member States.	2.0084657111780597
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.	3.0495208396151936
We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard.	2.516233185740162
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation.	2.4432457565905517
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	1.8189625578930018
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed.	3.54043467872346
Goebbels (PSE).	1.2834676391182434
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	2.059395432718677
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.	1.8428852688008648
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	2.158982438920428
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.	2.6146247951659416
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43.	3.202993994536167
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	1.8946875031274526
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner ' s outstanding bills.	2.297583280222249
We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society.	2.5054697953254643
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies.	2.3782409470407866
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG?	1.984723791648568
However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations.	2.126086486605518
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission ' s intentions.	3.0361926308762124
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	2.0660444157642703
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas.	2.3511070147880435
(Parliament gave its assent) President.	1.7261538290722018
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.	2.2372295328331986
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.	1.9493457004397954
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner ' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.	2.3098872023823835
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.6655276948602307
For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe.	2.513027022269948
These are serious matters on which this House must act.	2.276992699835533
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	2.61384650258924
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	2.811586866819677
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	2.219330916146077
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	1.6322059775497155
However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you.	2.1768325211163937
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.	2.9031482251850926
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.	2.4672797325704794
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	1.999403048510883
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	2.108136494624309
(Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays.	1.9503186823848488
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.	2.2280119471917317
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	2.4931705128311714
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.	2.283003772499252
The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations.	2.1260734911857817
Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.	2.417916771617422
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	2.6533700366834023
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	2.0667866929044245
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union 's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	2.0556473798035406
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.	2.6924374334839807
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.	2.3450881663953713
Regarding information and training, in the past this budget line has been allocated for information, communication and training.	1.9495041637321222
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.	3.5554640799750383
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	2.7492309115494473
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.	2.7418260808247035
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence, because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend, we will have to remember that, for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 are contributed by the European Union.	2.448941432765994
I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport.	2.0760565372799027
In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million.	1.8254935809407
Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process.	2.446854205466623
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	2.073340729478502
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	1.7725623925607297
By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious.	1.8893788541960297
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures.	2.43694355199418
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.	1.6112535443425735
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river.	2.115004912383773
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.	2.2352941348297684
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker ' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms.	2.526039537291468
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade.	2.106322340785315
Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?	2.663395240472501
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection.	2.721927877559278
At the same time, it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms, and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union, in the wake of the establishment of the internal market, the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy.	2.394378511341819
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.	3.4727817877555816
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.	2.365402393166804
But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.	2.1674015212162017
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	1.9705165731361967
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States ' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	2.168749071812402
Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	1.5425250985941854
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.	2.578400439022443
What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide.	2.0921959928492684
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members.	2.464650496183313
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.	2.063227113322142
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field.	2.5153553670716344
We are looking for solutions.	3.665994369618511
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.	2.396257249459017
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.020797597978323
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.	2.881315598302702
It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers.	2.1119585203323186
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States.	2.7542659991894394
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	2.9750480407232383
My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy.	2.5843109025768634
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU ' s water legislation.	2.316708505945931
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament ' s corresponding powers in this area.	2.591499295625819
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	3.20189074525522
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.	2.1240243649729984
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	2.4724208199918185
At any rate, the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union.	2.364542156848784
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.	1.6167816006649847
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace.	2.208405974728511
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people.	1.731542628746787
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	3.986134373809339
It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds.	2.494828187479946
Today ' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed, and one which I welcome.	2.141316739579685
The European Union ' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.	2.8568216819820127
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	2.1696379688517253
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	2.294538047363425
There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities.	2.574404445848588
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	2.5766857942228376
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.	2.51034186755065
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.	2.175647655755589
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	1.9098890681138152
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business.	2.231633867630917
Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	2.1789754786836104
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	1.8870911239089934
Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power.	1.7980236341023834
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally.	2.765870647143194
This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa.	1.9385090684564104
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.	2.8488189914929736
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	2.2198742839733123
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.	2.6847439828311828
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.	2.2873565974315113
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten ' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	2.5602017208293977
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	2.638869541266294
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.	3.111724626648087
This is why I am voting against the report.	2.5295040054936204
We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright.	2.560133615388082
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	2.597167597593992
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this.	1.534076539813401
I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.	2.4699985117349854
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	2.067100593873934
The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.	2.0810896637532337
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States.	1.7945619891159141
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	1.9110903234588237
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.7737084791327264
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology.	3.160828123307145
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	1.9520573536463763
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.	2.3987640177196123
One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion.	1.9356638569235303
It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly.	2.4448653444733677
But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others.	2.1845495936282417
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	3.09867843150501
(FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed.	2.085349209248368
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	2.476158885284908
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.	2.25685575373552
Result: a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself.	1.8585688560701719
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?	2.87926679100393
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those.	2.7548797896841855
There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that.	2.5517975336175627
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	2.630575631582807
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.	2.676716136478069
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	2.1607712567071946
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.	2.3377251501605083
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	2.0832134325813647
But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	3.096940287806896
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	2.4293578663908715
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report?	2.310046259653747
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary.	2.858705510364761
Two things, and Mrs Theato ' s report clearly spells these out.	2.008257781711017
Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under.	2.4789494044907325
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.	3.1241030992315095
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present.	2.4271702394573254
Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur ' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire.	2.086404304934777
Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.	1.760103818302782
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.	2.594132815330844
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.	2.534887198327418
My position on this is clear.	2.8115803284432817
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	2.222592872562653
A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD);	1.6361799453576589
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.	2.7148182512918537
This applies to them and us.	2.8861461748270285
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether.	2.5246003936589316
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance.	2.4847140106406433
The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water.	2.113902602614828
Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry, Mr Costa, and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed.	1.8405072937193114
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	2.1843883820391885
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	1.9786008868668379
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example.	2.9523277549113596
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	2.7074839110122104
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	2.427932180488021
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur.	3.3882638131128027
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.	2.2934423590919155
These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary.	2.341603429273272
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr Désir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	2.228569220701052
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?	2.398711230475979
I wish to discuss two matters.	3.1176425386111233
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.	2.793273383344006
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	2.4716218174894315
The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position.	2.4304506926439884
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	2.1148391425517716
Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational.	1.886617537553871
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	1.7007665151967817
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates.	2.0575538332312373
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	2.434178001256997
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	1.9552070982531875
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period, I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations.	1.868167234264191
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU ' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed.	2.614374572963491
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re-read the Commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office.	2.2359259344911484
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	2.145417251115205
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki, so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion, including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests.	2.773321501519866
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.	1.964372818641323
The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.	2.451928540064396
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	2.4396602395511175
We cannot leave it simply to governments.	2.7344799300508154
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	2.2261038807916114
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	2.261929546343382
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.	2.5500451345868163
This is also reflected in many of Parliament ' s amendments.	3.332572022319392
It has no right to do so.	2.6583382844986168
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.257309727822822
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	2.425939330847604
It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself.	2.141623080418745
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	2.4467910430167774
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	2.163193747382103
The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy!	2.82144482926417
Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ' .	2.053207578613881
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	2.3171812893278454
Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence.	2.0639856934488385
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	1.9196871473846138
My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue ' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities.	2.0292985026949135
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.	2.1736060360845837
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	2.350976743096721
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	2.3901425633793307
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	1.9441999749461998
Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.	2.3856318595510024
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	2.4022485902341164
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty.	1.896386362996609
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate.	2.068101792838122
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.	2.621866979590873
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.	2.1172740791902145
I believe that, over time, the Council of the European Union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue.	3.4665288514760677
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	2.0149339489402864
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council ' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.	3.081166865134077
LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States.	1.8911235862467919
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	2.4414028759319817
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	2.1171884302006267
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.	2.1763731346158526
That is something we would do well to recognise.	2.351432047691389
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.	2.5442998429012125
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems.	2.9232875703304413
I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.	2.4192866193798843
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.	2.2180503851706264
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament ' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	3.2936096176545084
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	2.701844227517295
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.	3.0874037248284005
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	2.2558836237997557
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations.	2.4332816246025253
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	1.8298424868570402
Once again, an indigenous people ' s right of existence is being threatened.	1.8921784361443486
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out.	2.337385203901738
We have listened to the Commission ' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation. This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy.	2.3131019268118655
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission ' s proposal on scrapie.	3.2561665877224284
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.	2.4632637590025905
I would first of all like to focus on quality.	2.9110830309702767
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	2.9805775883016383
But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol.	2.0307905743379178
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.	2.2718210824242786
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance.	2.381098178131441
In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.	2.057354933162729
In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives.	2.0963293653465573
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.	2.464502705248121
But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission.	1.8537600032617918
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.	2.931191369944813
That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention.	2.7271126028450663
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.	3.0610340370969897
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	1.6253874194468518
These will take place at a later date.	2.9313480329919326
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution.	2.5366899073599516
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.0142569855869588
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.	4.005554535669102
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.442712380239571
We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates.	2.593918646988593
What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse.	2.408593307748863
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	2.9972049458392176
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.	2.7382774437975477
For our part, we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere, because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union ' s image and to the Union ' s own particular identity.	2.5439891178012197
Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	1.9728140835850292
If the world ' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	2.4286692097756615
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	2.1691157002682684
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	2.240487655240841
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	2.642789005530843
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee.	2.6046882475983444
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	2.4536151627668024
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	2.454905650681084
In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets.	2.1577717716323486
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	2.640267822708328
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	1.9668432400536413
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	3.0404070845491464
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation.	3.729366274738734
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.	2.636831040613294
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.	2.8081268238212598
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament ' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests.	2.598088655661184
The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade.	2.4754200629418417
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers.	2.6630460176645845
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	3.1221367652083294
B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	2.145762061762466
The foregoing is the reason for our vote.	3.299751454663705
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world ' s most contaminated areas.	1.855670414721074
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent.	2.1763904899605557
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	2.329705085301743
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe.	1.6517374737454584
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	2.117902772941999
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health.	2.4576212086429203
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China.	2.131319431054282
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	2.480744790740202
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation ' s treaties.	1.890973289964889
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends.	3.7371420618090623
In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows.	2.7645456673402786
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	2.2259028499220403
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission.	2.820792997984542
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world ' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.	1.943192520960435
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted.	2.758740871458618
We are right to blacklist Haider ' s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination.	2.040170871494608
Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently.	2.6778623208214363
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	2.3480959061962388
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council ' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	2.2994416904725896
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	2.3141486675334337
This must be regulated during the IGC.	2.8144214699726833
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	2.2050269554405335
At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.	2.1686922492396876
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.	2.2182999918130424
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	2.4034086662918837
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.	2.1714375403789257
The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves.	3.2721896964226627
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	3.3522887758176094
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.	2.322411892507511
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative.	1.979277878196842
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.	3.564139254544337
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP.	1.8248864861077565
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved.	1.9647467723373062
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	2.4834809331910477
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.	2.3658970170098788
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported.	2.672209729750892
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!	2.2986617657000865
I believe that this is actually a good thing.	3.1239992361639897
We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.	2.5387314418184252
At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.	1.9719219301908106
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability.	3.184165654456973
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	2.370856027920345
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.	2.428837345168288
Women deserve more than a quota.	2.2538537206485696
The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa.	2.355528820094583
However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.	2.6137045387837867
What could be the cause of this?	2.8061927041000416
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	2.4420014417320184
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting.	1.9993374741645518
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.	2.800995352931382
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	1.937211659677353
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	2.2613576482085254
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.	1.8524661556096156
Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report.	2.860532764263908
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco.	2.0149029823655367
What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.	3.0964322038400702
A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.	1.9343234035498544
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	1.6800791901158687
That should be our task, not political posturing.	2.3323425307290675
Today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.	1.8156775070966267
There, the border question is obviously central.	1.5890793114819295
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	2.164394093002217
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	2.118298233145486
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union.	2.4473211990140933
Recourse to the precautionary principle	2.1311226208597684
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities.	2.414198697938067
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.	1.816135598720053
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	2.0981932502726575
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted, local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux. The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans.	1.8923276347926363
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission 's practical commitment to that.	1.9373477558810186
Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal.	2.079725792914019
Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity, this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid: one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources.	2.6016976145408286
I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy ' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).	2.130720119327447
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven.	2.8431865761966018
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.	2.276254832373403
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended	1.5380859182317992
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive.	2.1894766226538085
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	2.1578202782176956
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.	2.626193387398142
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report.	3.4647638610813765
So our response must be rapid and strong.	2.1572688163441933
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters, including preventing conflicts, is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique.	2.3717795971753834
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	2.2804869399175876
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	1.9632195059995556
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!	1.8873168284303967
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.	3.292541498901654
He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve.	1.6629112362711012
We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market.	2.616006660078296
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission ' s viewpoint.	2.545422948331504
.	1.374839594702952
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	3.1111979045413074
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	1.6709446070218035
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify.	2.4493216227767163
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner ' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	2.3803109966409575
I have evidence that this is possible.	4.131822850326643
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	2.6881043901061394
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	2.134022765384011
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	2.8357696644811714
There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree.	1.9385192460260854
Mr Rübig has the floor.	2.9392250207564286
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.	1.8636076943664726
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war.	2.2107608341504164
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.	1.9091696102256916
.	1.374839594702952
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	2.511682606547123
European postal services	2.2300013847057905
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities ' historical and cultural role.	2.0149525454634047
Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road.	2.050814007708321
It is the humane face of Europe.	2.4310763520737417
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it.	1.8218330403794247
.	1.374839594702952
Parliament has frequently made that point.	1.8333668382308037
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.	2.691326086410744
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.	2.0467237431622074
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	2.2365622134546532
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	2.6361188910163853
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.	1.7129563671145986
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	2.0851197011914153
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	2.556552804815203
We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience.	2.217548173972499
Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship.	2.2410019259754375
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	2.4080058745520327
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	2.1272003494685516
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	1.9550991813570073
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	2.838621560125008
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.	1.970292539082722
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	2.106722202982027
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.	2.080634023008807
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.	2.524112458094525
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods.	2.9691494430378507
We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument.	2.4640682306912614
As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State.	2.8302138841257563
Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers.	1.727897008172929
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	1.9554314617561073
Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union.	1.5871094231358716
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	1.9001984494747495
In three weeks ' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.	2.369316467975698
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.	2.0020863847213883
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	2.1734807160691765
This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.	2.021948280617428
Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark.	2.0664599997980893
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. for a formal sitting on the occasion of an address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic and resumed at 12.50 p.m.)	1.7625758529377302
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.	3.1085856049100387
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	3.9858595206090697
The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life.	2.1631894432218832
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.	2.6206533574733495
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	1.8198198259116047
I have a related point.	3.476344092290617
The Commission ' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.	2.019061597520109
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	2.513242490919715
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.	2.279522255377795
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	2.3939505925984585
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	2.5256260945573676
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.	2.266961714358591
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU ' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider ' s electoral success.	2.5383405665678387
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	2.429177088568371
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	2.247009269197196
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer ' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union ' s budget.	2.237195464041512
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	2.1414318773908123
Mr President, I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.	2.0254149440078324
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	2.6118457168634355
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	2.7329772240493924
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	2.5846575568986165
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	2.1224768222379824
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	1.8027131276905048
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	2.1723542711668933
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again.	1.648647260636853
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	2.5398595841340526
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this.	2.443148884631632
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.	1.9843442728013951
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	2.2085055096312898
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	2.3676273169475004
That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success, now and in the future.	2.728632413180557
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical.	3.115790661399791
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth.	2.404233070979636
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	2.643616141252091
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order.	2.27661493537933
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.	2.898191123538806
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	2.521274324804697
However, the financial controllers must work independently.	2.4329965272510807
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.	2.484923418655404
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.	2.7001617650308685
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	1.9127833246172816
Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.	2.6056815591338447
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	2.6545777099801184
However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives.	2.622190776194586
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	2.694880663068428
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	2.4283772673547457
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain.	2.2071559114314034
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	2.3765896885908986
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.	2.0842977353217798
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe.	1.8936020872841919
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?	2.530173065521071
It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development.	2.2022595021692606
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN ' s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967?	1.9314324610030584
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	3.1311879406686867
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux, consultation and control, and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place.	1.8874767200990605
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.	3.48405742619552
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.	2.34001443432469
Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position.	2.1010579556967213
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.	1.913642993968372
How would you describe this?	2.1158334528933698
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.	2.077408661003796
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	2.180013600120826
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	2.194826213913224
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged.	2.636425698634979
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	1.6271028312399647
weighting of votes in the Council	1.84756209369513
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP).	2.2931905705827464
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	1.95275211935526
Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe.	2.102848016919415
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves.	2.072924764402402
However, the aid needed now is difficult to get through, despite the efforts of the NGOs, because the roads, bridges and railway lines are damaged.	1.9986079638152945
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	1.932457864692526
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.	2.4943116207500733
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider ' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	2.240628851374511
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	1.9360944302978265
It must be known.	3.0458623496103883
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	2.380002727966217
Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance, reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do.	2.653387355656633
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops.	2.1479977404075785
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	2.2230244274531867
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	2.8208943761093814
The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight.	2.2770004667332704
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	2.428787461386731
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	2.627921228380085
Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which, from an agronomic point of view, and since I come from a southern country, I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive.	2.373070791905965
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.	2.73397088144586
Mr Medina Ortega, I naturally share your concerns and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own, the country currently holding the presidency, is naturally very concerned about this issue, all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own.	2.2992484794886607
Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue.	2.5925339237480176
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature.	2.318436415823231
Mrs Stenzel ' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	2.0268352868089115
The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive.	2.1991549821085767
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.	2.5892032866795835
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	2.1053185803394086
This must be brought forward.	3.382349326441731
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.	2.429600885746726
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament ' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	2.74635196113828
Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said.	2.141714727402633
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days.	2.902049149993196
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people.	3.011164415794109
. (DE) Mr Cohn-Bendit, I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country ' s domestic politics, in the way that you are doing.	2.651246280207055
He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve.	1.8092814751100672
Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators.	2.2264264019802527
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way.	2.8261790892041403
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug ' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	1.999143973780005
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	1.6559611098234557
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	1.81244268890456
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM.	2.003908149826787
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull ' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	1.9091955944103147
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.	1.9674849730836588
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.	2.488327580100497
These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention.	2.093101459255959
Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.	2.154373475999689
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	2.3628672806584254
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.	1.9189743877599073
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	2.60379205337756
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd.	2.3191547058536908
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	2.1923897773866403
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	2.423076426299516
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	2.154271881214116
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers.	2.850529938343691
In such cases, there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers, thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy.	2.3712799553816555
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	2.4128410333864747
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.	2.265057199614356
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	2.0178183181162597
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	2.806028008992865
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.	2.787970614848821
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	1.5450068004272293
Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.	1.7161542690343365
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	2.007865655068597
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens.	1.9470220454640967
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	2.8034261239361586
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms.	2.516523428675063
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture ' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world.	2.451792360947856
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	2.413891276816293
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.	3.661509751369243
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war, when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists, still goose-stepping, the party of the Waffen SS.	2.0381150592834323
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism.	2.151250923706792
Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations.	2.8101371179422245
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.	2.2938856669040573
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	1.6634373680058792
In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman ' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.	2.164201317929216
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.	2.1458200278820945
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?	2.049268506044096
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever.	2.0559614030715503
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole.	2.6967659523644882
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.	2.5893035982529113
To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty.	2.583767816487344
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)	1.5540944303769562
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.	3.025480313994613
I am thinking in particular of countries such as Cuba which are isolated but I know, because I have travelled there extensively, that the Cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world, obtain different information and pass on different information.	1.8119738306574995
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.	1.946768185754902
The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.	2.2000644351697107
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation.	1.8886377462382131
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems.	2.364283175257619
The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Asia, where there is greater opportunity for profit.	2.0635604936816425
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.	3.2777612670624388
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights.	1.7855099185311953
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	3.5692596075544754
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	1.9045194900349207
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people.	2.6676444171636615
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first.	2.64086767567448
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.	2.4420334721609187
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.	2.6133492428223764
Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues.	1.7907516899492797
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States.	2.7361292550096534
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
As regards fishing proper, passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit.	2.0024722943787956
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.	2.536039116775546
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.	1.5687557098482143
It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner.	2.742178623292619
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	2.67406429750073
If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.	2.6815211483320325
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	2.2005134308844463
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	2.067557295664521
It is, however, interested in official statements and actions.	2.263946569031825
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.	2.461583356740508
Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally, it cannot command any authority.	1.6238897336974358
There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees.	2.155939780674497
I wish you a good evening.	3.1918522484479546
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.	2.247144800629977
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.	2.0365688254654506
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory?	2.546249897527336
In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN ' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen.	2.3014848762345292
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.	1.9746785920435845
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	2.1737511843044603
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	2.0415108855823307
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	2.1359182685158613
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	3.1911144736666697
This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values.	2.5784559252288424
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.	2.5221553088637982
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.	2.572113899610196
Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees.	2.0078002678643876
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	2.601540086561591
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	2.456125830656291
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security.	2.057485590555791
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent ' and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so ' .	2.318117921325972
I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these.	2.3482878722451535
It must be visible.	2.6462362796255876
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates.	2.9076110353425753
Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements.	2.242756267571602
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.	1.7954063986141648
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	1.7817062273832245
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.	2.2358553273211244
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	2.4361367825263542
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector.	1.9694661493816803
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company ' s decision.	2.2574071951021146
The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products.	2.2066202998501394
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	2.0199099242954666
My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade.	1.6809464329181785
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.	2.2535375595611824
On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law.	1.691241014144593
They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union ' s political will.	2.640698891462085
(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor ' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.	1.7872608681490798
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within.	2.588192690228528
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones.	2.8377369290441474
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	2.238979160228421
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	2.154183774924052
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union ' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?	2.7374235448060387
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.	2.270272973285725
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business.	2.0103242272529207
Quite the reverse, in fact.	1.4241026035319764
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.	1.9201436827903386
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.	2.267825737547619
Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report.	2.200118734501722
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries.	1.6518327972972315
By focusing the Community 's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States.	1.81757679911724
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.	2.121006850951496
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.	2.674184333382286
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.	2.3747444448629373
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner ' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration.	2.4557339164767815
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.	2.2562041639120727
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	2.253672185198383
For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding.	1.7740319207915598
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7.	2.749742995134682
As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects.	2.0374100392893553
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600.	2.809750493112045
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation ' .	1.8591021735146245
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.	2.030486132151159
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	2.583844661229512
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	2.357924757567822
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	2.2230435270435356
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament.	3.262388577443964
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.	2.379103163499524
I cannot accept that.	3.560098055158932
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.	2.389330611256266
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	1.6912474468235588
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	2.8787352503193775
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	2.4333239516936938
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11, except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months, as I explained just now.	1.8946021269953401
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.	2.008200418864935
But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual.	2.606405505426271
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework.	3.4009035714479046
Does not the Council ' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?	2.606612585223102
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	2.658655673625311
Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy.	2.182364217734286
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit.	2.300064175965219
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.	2.532595599810691
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	2.4662212060200672
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings.	2.2033330343954987
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.	2.0800909480722156
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	2.1272617592520153
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union ' s foreign policy.	2.576317812953095
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	2.440044699434128
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.	2.305330771888095
The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem.	3.707794359333324
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	1.9358165211999618
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.	2.3549612006412066
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	2.014099456200875
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect.	2.342923295675371
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	2.157969089546087
And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.	3.3339337414423214
This is my first additional question.	2.7086784722038737
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference.	2.7147770246231246
In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked.	2.58413483361668
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	2.7669173073642868
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	2.3110483586368615
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	1.864461588134813
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	1.5590415898120988
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	2.3249301750569065
I am proud to support such a resolution.	2.654871103445559
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	1.934250024800107
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	2.2940316686780067
So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance.	1.9109599218159328
Bluefin tuna is the world ' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons.	1.967506014555593
A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.	2.210549979255668
Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	2.838626899401599
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur.	2.0294373936985237
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	3.0857198725691313
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.	2.186270054392413
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission ' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .	2.6977015372821693
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	2.9566192645528386
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries.	2.309782010691644
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)	1.3500748012495505
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.	2.2682769174497084
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	2.2112748620299243
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons.	3.160981266353389
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.	2.5928780717123
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.	1.8842739616614763
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.	2.565309882243585
As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.37475284483007
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	2.337068407253302
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD).	1.8297186686219178
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms.	1.9716586907008702
That is important, for at least three reasons.	2.2361283251778534
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	2.246239946101163
As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources.	2.136255048535185
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	2.085175538647431
Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable.	2.5417445896414006
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.	1.8428674574764452
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	2.439753805363225
Report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)	1.949372078577582
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety.	2.784268311347011
I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces.	2.4304860457410356
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts.	1.7476318532620374
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	3.003153574848625
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade.	1.611786690558417
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.	2.479991259147656
They have now got to grips with "EU" .	2.114917110973924
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	2.219924541756724
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	2.817410956360512
Mr President, the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations, based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe, for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent.	2.430185284829801
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.	1.7283018081277304
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:	1.7127353281576372
As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty.	2.299260556456793
Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream.	1.5003672467565932
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	2.1877437957199937
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	2.452068953926389
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative ' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.	2.381724836416022
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	2.221783628885917
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples.	1.7662640625590385
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	1.9557219033055768
After shellfish, the slump is now affecting crustacean sales.	1.728322462079177
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.	2.4457449924530557
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.	2.9817328162699663
Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now.	2.2822392299967147
It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a duplicitous package, involves increased repression and control.	2.2724922520248656
Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence.	2.7664239889118853
But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward.	2.4949575917546865
Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place.	2.0471405732792936
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	1.6586672461763583
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	2.2419042029169476
Why should this be the case?	2.084775654705985
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: "Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such" .	2.5986019582816464
This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu.	3.1747228970510277
I have two further points to make on this process.	2.656903400130881
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.848462825470744
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.	2.3808630942216786
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice.	1.969549121492016
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	2.221805466474405
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented.	2.2907457550353536
My second criticism follows on from the first.	2.267695769202003
I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved.	2.2900695276756773
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination	1.6113254861241366
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world.	2.0364083460189857
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	2.0852004769932044
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission.	2.294299490457768
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	2.613079386716734
Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced.	1.5354155208077414
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points.	2.07621268414715
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.	1.795486208406305
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community ' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.	2.2784321365961335
Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty.	2.4432461978519147
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified.	2.595138368262313
On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation ' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion.	2.8916358728181777
Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children.	2.2922478572995453
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	2.72215735701912
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.	2.0689926638862133
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now.	3.353570807193539
In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances.	2.0091448560490957
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	1.9015400881673319
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	2.1039345453786304
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	2.052007021108993
I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land.	1.977063709196703
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners.	1.8119369128625578
Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future.	2.682307641198662
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this.	2.407516329000714
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.	2.4200084222458567
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	1.8334860992849022
What is the Commission ' s verdict on this?	2.956630308764623
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.	3.1711763641699044
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective.	2.306706059155567
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission ' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	2.4495877532752885
In the Commission guidelines, few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA. The amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented.	2.0595293138851662
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.	3.4076879935168822
That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions.	3.0269571526949064
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.	2.0948272090845497
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	2.423766790001894
That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected.	2.203476911101964
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	2.7290831177070043
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system.	2.2864889937256905
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?	2.219604348737433
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length.	2.0842299198375795
The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either.	2.938112562105988
Finally, the Commission 's human resource policy must be modernised.	2.504891059466043
I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much.	2.442122515564521
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated.	2.4886995378833676
It is still the old imperial service.	3.000123273409282
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme.	2.693289426104414
The question is: who prosecutes?	3.229673429468382
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	2.2814109716138202
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.	2.967540194753792
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	1.89814385295337
Very well, I shall do so.	1.6741306045425497
So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place.	2.28281841535032
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.	2.0158246362908527
The Commission ' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware.	3.7541144454906084
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January.	2.338624482717729
Natural habitats were destroyed.	1.269130208423281
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how.	2.368173242862769
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe.	2.063441665903165
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	2.4709965210617586
We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction.	2.3452596462399424
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	3.0263342457436457
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	1.6200222834250375
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission ' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.	2.8955601029709506
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.	2.0149413102355647
Where does all that leave us this year?	1.7249174820821969
That is not the sort of postal service that we want.	2.5850115922909214
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	2.434096741609022
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	1.7446481589131189
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.	2.4969118351898736
There is huge duplication of effort.	2.3125075292458073
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur ' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	2.3380526718574197
Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.	2.0381132307741416
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability.	2.20811884564909
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	2.7296703294529787
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	2.632573730268461
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	2.5937144827991014
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease.	2.997761229378481
On the other hand, the new Austrian Government ' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights.	2.09915034055601
What is the role of the scientific committees?	3.1451850413542033
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	2.372646007120841
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.	1.432555072200962
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	2.9234476844361006
It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission ' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way.	2.5041149158113205
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.	2.0273193857783385
I would like to draw people 's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	2.1975352809250785
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	1.9731677712629379
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.	2.9353543015615067
I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.	1.9585312172522336
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	2.062627339884078
The maritime world has great potential.	2.953377619748879
The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.	1.961863220894734
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States.	2.02346807887186
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example.	2.5767366881875042
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.	2.190123801245918
First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive.	2.099842794733965
Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way.	2.0964226817969607
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	2.03658456380298
Furthermore, this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission ' s involvement in this undertaking.	3.4144067656897215
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.	2.3500457330852638
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	2.0059438149106827
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on.	2.5542335989804594
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	2.8242100700892605
I wish we were closer to that.	2.782416065441525
Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments.	2.7106441022945007
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	2.414961119410314
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.	2.749067696336227
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues.	2.4104767987100795
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	2.699014808987641
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months ' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	2.013796511588306
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.	1.993975116500941
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	2.1449636556554403
I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones.	2.174674970525206
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.	2.331306899048913
Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these.	2.578018858838535
Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter.	1.8408625042550462
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.	2.5484303665109334
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report.	2.3626563738479036
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.	2.9668251833177552
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.	2.7262348233313474
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux.	2.0919841820467964
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	1.9850720450478108
This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue.	3.031318786123249
Parliament ' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets.	2.712374422266176
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	2.247747021356719
It is time for action.	3.3195622185496507
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive.	1.9820057495586731
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission.	2.1827165629271783
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.	1.9438549185212024
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.	1.8085856428569893
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni.	2.2167396440741585
With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission.	2.4771164160688057
This needs to be said!	3.8835002555226525
This war must be stopped.	3.066620777297989
He is not stupid. Certainly not!	1.828258582179249
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	2.1055288645611725
Nevertheless, I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition, which will evidently imply some concessions.	2.1205509460309226
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.	2.4182167733607627
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	2.6967080565747685
I am convinced that the rapporteur ' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament.	2.5575998362412773
There are no boundaries for Community policies.	2.1966233800992874
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):	1.9854210476319005
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	2.0796926224977037
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	2.247462933953079
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.	2.5143714434773874
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher ' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.	2.1426671235341876
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.	2.571635310164217
Then, by gearing actions to micro-projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and, finally, by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba, which all the ACP called for at Nassau and which has now made a formal application.	1.887076731307882
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work.	2.049529081372517
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices.	2.675377286833142
I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House.	2.1871485065942924
- (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.	1.982027563940667
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45.	2.348605892937611
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	2.230175711666481
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment.	2.5939431413532636
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time.	2.3278477563421607
Mr President, Mr Andersson ' s report contains a lot that is of interest.	2.6971325678034366
The European Commission ' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.	2.5980187571996645
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	2.7060801926460183
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.	2.8197183363792533
This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.	2.1919579400635465
Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	2.0763362016287767
If you are, when exactly are you going to do it?	2.2022586877533774
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.	2.6017852538818698
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up.	3.20810089737311
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.	1.968518755465566
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	1.8652563374762618
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended.	2.339401866230137
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	2.9162332056144873
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration.	2.1942997463202127
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece 's contribution amount to?	2.4035860071738036
This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it!	2.839943735218845
You may draw your own conclusions.	2.264003085858336
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.	3.3311874477912857
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	2.4402340318845788
The proposals in Mrs Theato ' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.	2.3143424939190105
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	1.951290023290405
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.	2.3483743028935478
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.	2.285291794991617
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	2.2000350197021374
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mentioned, we must remember that there is still room for progress.	2.256030050198355
This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty.	2.500969967102142
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting.	1.6588257184850732
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	2.5043326628164406
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	2.173324275004944
If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.	2.145371145795887
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.	2.3049523831025867
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States ' programmes?	2.81581571275765
Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.	2.0423073709617814
For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke ' s question on this issue.	1.927114992349198
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.	1.9078864844491874
Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union.	2.5684329495601435
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	1.5860580292991349
My final point is this.	2.185092816729843
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro!	2.446638725793963
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.	2.7611882988399477
It will be a force comprised of various national units.	2.8424139880435852
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	1.98857777932971
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country.	2.2658513816765256
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	2.793874907820739
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	1.7122000899095893
The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way.	2.2721514287348508
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	2.2540554905001717
That is what we are lacking, Commissioner: the political will to make a start in tackling speculation.	2.4939623726640985
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.	2.604582204991487
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account?	2.385871910142756
Mr President, the European Union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.	2.487043996752046
Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making?	1.9713721999600824
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	2.4388326446798088
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste.	1.8896823948585695
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	2.5032903974764307
In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges.	3.635111419149447
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	1.466027201365193
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	1.7258310360180322
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	1.8706324657008957
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	2.264223030823115
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.	2.8932358950770025
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	1.9606744663700715
Furthermore, the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development.	1.8212295998322372
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women?	2.5693888455108906
At the same time, however, we shut our eyes to the Union ' s own problems: to the violence, inequality, and fourth world reality, which is part of everyday life in the EU.	1.9882581193455726
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals ' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states ' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	2.234896952737632
Hence the transmission.	1.6552745819514705
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.	2.58479656718454
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	2.3145256494029662
The rapporteur ' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	2.9865133775393966
I should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism, the tourism exported from the Member States of the European Union. I am referring to sex tourism.	2.6842030868816122
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	2.694873481841106
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.	2.17140421789922
I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects.	2.4303922250250096
However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking.	2.0219673048959814
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	2.2445010397968317
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s.	1.9143503406828752
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy ' s internal conflict.	2.3622920828149594
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission ' s own initiative.	2.272646533049395
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour.	2.764705768176213
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.	2.5710208712314726
So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services.	1.9891871764444353
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	1.6659105407583599
But what do these sanctions mean?	2.4584273913603054
But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge.	2.007201351242938
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question.	2.171838732613064
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission ' s support programmes.	2.4296886983648465
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view.	2.9104037588365435
He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so!	2.2175661777484854
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	2.478043105356495
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	2.099489020325499
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.	2.174063915295225
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term.	2.4105839404933898
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.	3.551411629949677
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.	2.2538470454119595
We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union.	2.1071777913186827
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	1.9497239995195075
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course.	2.054748578310401
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.	2.166572620469859
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	2.80123899508281
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	1.7095658863416279
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.	2.501457407565195
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	1.9732522824779821
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	2.7065478480395004
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.	2.510165802010889
I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism.	2.466547466185597
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	2.5301069262400655
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN, is it not about time you abandoned your traditional, conservative views on refugees and immigrants?	1.9519039984465631
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.	1.8567436699202209
I have a number of ideas which should be put across.	4.134866542491842
. Mr President, I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs -some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lomé Agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.	2.0060756984019266
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	2.2079364931002643
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	2.115556209301102
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	2.2206915162671064
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.	1.7161944165933438
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union.	3.7578190084255048
The overriding features of today ' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.	2.101208638533953
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	2.5054169106917614
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	2.5669880079721006
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	1.8411709916317762
The appeal by the European Socialists, on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel, raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation.	2.43662821015255
Last year ' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues.	1.8658954655302
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.	3.176184241983128
Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	2.4028574495554302
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem.	2.484878927343583
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough.	2.6821974844984444
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco ' s view.	2.0168075209961462
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	2.286013948589092
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences.	2.5890161350614864
It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated.	1.920336849302166
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.	2.9075768035585385
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	2.7310761550240805
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.6990030507974727
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union.	2.708090719698037
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	2.553632989680652
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices.	2.661293195434023
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people ' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	2.28218573802212
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	2.7675416033592355
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism.	3.494089247349648
We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety.	2.302779460481215
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense.	1.9321800009653494
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	2.421787998071666
That concludes Question Time.	2.205777470426928
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.	2.3916323465062677
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	2.269891262404248
You have one minute each in which to ask your question.	2.078140404064174
Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners ' Party, there have been many occasions on which I have stated, at the committee stage, that the European Union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly, and in the measures and rules on pensions, as is already the case, in coordination.	2.3726682621574438
'Long-winded ' .	1.2049264093908156
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.	2.34592678810995
But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh.	1.8224590936838116
I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate.	3.109264849574124
The challenge of enlargement is political.	3.219118735799435
The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union.	2.2823922227101154
Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front?	2.385320043353498
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.	2.105949404551045
As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament.	2.484861594592155
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	2.0259923672971367
Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today.	2.3679432917523453
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	2.8291468992364246
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	1.8533444896632434
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.	1.8334578598849962
The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control.	2.434581270712859
But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means.	1.8669548864706125
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	2.3215619206588087
I pay special tribute to him for his success.	2.731324196260294
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	2.7133894414486277
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	2.405335971036223
It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full.	2.22065581688453
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.	2.125288570299083
Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.	2.553777826839723
Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away.	1.8873300999061289
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.	1.5847892796933378
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House, Mr President, I should like to make a clarification.	2.8988943791332558
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	2.8645541356881057
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	2.8721011717347884
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.	2.3005148644379294
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.	1.7557890437253343
She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.	1.8221266098940787
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.	2.3010523163860093
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU ' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group.	2.193365392467501
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	1.8482075367454138
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	2.600760272218344
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	1.971567278397746
Cross-border services	1.5465204082268484
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	2.03438252447392
Russia ' s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: 'As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free. '	1.6209505360781558
It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union ' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars.	2.598222092696258
The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission ' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level.	2.315296356469667
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them.	1.8921718105897427
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	2.067977315908275
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves.	2.2370711753550303
There is still much to be done, however.	2.686716461143573
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	2.9140238663845803
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	2.288442505639755
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.	2.2133219135236333
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	1.955800238824328
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.	2.1240953908630473
We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area.	2.3414971187266533
I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.	2.696577079942496
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	2.038916303512366
The Commission ' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie.	2.085452806309821
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	2.1224842422721246
We know what actually happened.	3.03172301633625
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament.	1.5575777096036303
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.	2.609977304540525
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.	2.789568376492513
And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow.	2.3934966969112366
Secondly, it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries.	1.9986204923197575
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.	2.6536440990619052
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	2.4013518036883545
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures.	2.555649207645561
However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be.	2.29394464175975
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level.	1.5889483932738417
These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care.	2.3100576991829334
I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel.	2.503611602532716
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.	1.8521347393046879
Coordination is the key word here.	1.718899450390663
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities.	1.6578726281716634
But the Council ' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts.	2.229269633836321
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.	2.2472559388147153
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration.	2.441971396901459
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means.	2.2871441536805945
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	3.0730567201868935
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way.	2.1260866411785377
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there.	1.970125714527352
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.	2.1642607665175295
How have these been organised by Mr Solana ' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?	1.8138486216910155
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political.	2.3202944089272965
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand.	2.384246601905902
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.	2.274233735823188
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	3.0855956494315198
As Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents.	1.8494227871621818
In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued.	2.0591016908334794
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	1.907464824733434
It is about keeping communities together.	2.626357300111209
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power ' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.	2.0678557095025623
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches.	2.618875138868947
Thank you for your attention.	2.127048417204777
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	2.051556421855211
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council 's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	2.0840031700394435
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	2.9161268067808446
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	1.949956440560811
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency ' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members.	2.7664815616357545
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions.	2.2556225562467276
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	2.4196822299175342
Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee.	2.1503561031652687
Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington.	1.8045121630372558
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality.	1.9865881870739335
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.	2.8583287328375295
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.	2.0262009184345575
Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human.	1.8284064962525626
We must put a stop to this trend.	2.635098730401036
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	2.238026704779687
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: "Reforming the Commission" .	2.50150964351934
In short, the issue is an important one.	3.071004202725571
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner ' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	2.408162256094515
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	2.0536883330457227
Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet ' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.	1.897315450798321
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	2.187165201736205
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	2.973772261654722
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	3.5587292015513547
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	2.926158084800211
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.	3.4266865920138283
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime.	2.837979733670108
I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic ' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen.	2.41701113461003
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.	2.3997440716002876
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	2.397011844335814
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	2.7491072986060896
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland.	2.3741056443169755
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic.	1.9849413925886807
I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable.	2.4346936654883073
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.	2.073086471503563
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	3.3144143892649063
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.	2.224168269075351
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	2.4737610833360106
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.	1.5818561797785884
However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way.	2.1170644590857264
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	2.49958636014783
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	2.4307060380574272
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	1.9910519512720777
The goal of the Commission ' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection.	3.1768489658730608
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.	2.035276540627093
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	2.7470761431662654
Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe.	1.9714380991726652
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch.	1.8343603575824172
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	2.2261073919198475
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.	2.5520766426786725
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays ' must be applied.	2.246150326666353
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	3.2006485436372913
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns.	3.1606142894757334
This is key as regards the future of this issue.	3.4128592879911266
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not.	2.931035904048769
The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them.	2.6523663208948696
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide.	2.5697123047953605
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.	1.9207952063087923
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse.	1.969963258044014
What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues.	2.2160460094058037
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	3.5028977007819533
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	2.719981707046639
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	1.9673829688676625
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.	3.0659123738836347
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	2.196567419112563
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	1.9968681482546649
Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible.	2.325063172582375
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	2.0758089879143866
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force.	1.7804346503872963
I wonder how this will develop.	3.113117123913116
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	2.484490581699066
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	2.488210189861841
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	2.9831095713022195
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols, and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on cyber crime.	2.485154601783057
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.	2.7718799315339027
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	1.9803010995475152
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.	2.0228503562941786
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	2.8128664218159902
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	2.597123143328715
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.	2.9581982576481423
I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way.	2.4825372905760665
As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions.	2.2763234811502744
Mr President, today ' s debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress.	1.9270754373661236
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today ' s economy?	2.267708537204705
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	2.2200872374190483
The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement.	2.49461477236654
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	2.124883772151258
That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.	2.207944535711248
The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council.	3.1120805141099606
The new Commission 's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office.	2.7277063621953808
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives.	2.199440727593862
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	1.9450972159998987
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation ' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	1.9866650725203725
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	2.186403472326446
Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.	2.0755794328843558
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	1.9307941868160565
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	1.6732614766989944
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003.	3.651655699686735
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	3.112843978881759
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	2.2147036605484427
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.	2.1108408229496396
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	2.67498594002096
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	1.9250115121496645
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.	1.8395960105157796
In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet.	2.260869918057253
I do not believe so.	3.1663465558145174
Agenda	1.0773763300143226
Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds.	2.834070034760472
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can.	2.414923355118648
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.	2.677057312604192
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	2.5879422758745867
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	2.526101378768684
We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost.	2.6651488895203217
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	2.7047096537220545
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.	2.0663750911166767
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	2.0112710229573234
Coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part-session both my report and Mr Katiforis ' s report on fisheries and the environment. The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow.	1.8999731331163066
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.	2.5959701466440452
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	2.255035739026895
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.	2.1622464179764456
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	1.578291924371716
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	2.867337309344016
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	2.885563809020997
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	2.5671329796605717
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	1.956184272618695
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	1.881782515268229
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.	2.5388937702339183
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question.	3.022032297309057
I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union ' s policy on the environment.	2.9138094941142083
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.	2.0674194815896656
It should continue along this path.	2.9262350287510857
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.	1.9946589300221462
Given this context, I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago.	2.263259259223849
Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character.	2.2750059290566322
I wholeheartedly agree.	4.556124962312152
Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States.	1.7791765183874968
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	2.3339745631632383
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.	2.098067880290467
In this sense, I share Commissioner Patten ' s positive attitude.	2.3243752340182366
They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population.	3.199521870719135
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report.	2.7467987842251946
We have been told how, currently, people 's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.	2.2687529668052524
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating.	2.4260502379251774
We all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, certain action must be taken.	1.9415607994544806
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	2.2097123302796757
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987.	2.1314885355496767
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear.	2.5604078106529045
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	4.234738152427409
Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.	2.4859947081687994
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	1.6755401054122296
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement.	2.3605803485394987
In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party, the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success.	1.8386479345945976
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council.	2.2368975307767984
Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda.	2.1065918659793192
There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster.	1.7928564273317613
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.	1.8026027883991005
(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.442712380239571
Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament.	2.299703791586434
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	2.0357632124773875
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi ' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider ' s Freedom Party.	2.3513398381469464
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.	2.990970727864679
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.	2.274726632065476
However, it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union.	2.6787532262400804
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	2.4675528430356586
Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today.	2.4423414613826258
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.	2.551005014693061
This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.	2.3593747482440275
This is something to which we all want to contribute.	3.3603815968605146
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge.	3.0842141309367084
I did not defend attacks on civilians.	2.872620483466576
They see a beautiful planet, teeming with life, but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up.	1.6573215241682988
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.	2.492416553935416
I was myself a car worker before I was elected.	2.4403108723410343
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	2.1580956645715457
Surely Assad would be Barak ' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.	1.8412838175617685
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.	2.345147991483741
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message.	2.175763508184878
.	1.374839594702952
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!	2.8362609414205346
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies ' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion.	1.7161322350834582
When we discuss the TSE regulation, Commissioner, we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation, such as cosmetics, medicinal products or animal feed.	1.831271483750997
A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	1.8413803315093256
During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy.	1.9576066728835217
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	2.4477348232898075
Take Sudan.	1.7789309088061844
Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned ' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State ' should be added after 'Where ' .	1.7278275514459664
With regard to Cuba ' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba ' s application.	1.9482067663437086
And why should we not note that the Commission ' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women ' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?	2.769169037817453
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	1.9551010443418546
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry.	2.3402628197165365
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	2.5255270541296593
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale.	2.357482001627188
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror.	1.7384247323346853
The starting point for the Commission ' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States ' being able to maintain their social security arrangements.	2.924771997053302
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House.	3.1070341426315924
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.	1.9181706396908393
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	2.261408467039992
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question.	3.1859943237665815
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	1.9609483247639743
We will also pass this on to our services, however.	2.462032616506525
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government.	2.664491001667171
How decisions are made is all-important.	2.3412184397766964
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism ' s contribution to job creation.	2.186045695741092
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone.	2.144450302134118
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.	2.2628378757341943
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	2.22238699650795
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	1.832743248558818
The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union.	2.638882933822834
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here.	2.4399701639923106
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate.	2.397624845986343
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.	2.321484051089265
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power?	1.6297775277074353
These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc.	2.136899391741903
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	2.6332085787695187
Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition.	2.0384424155113465
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	2.6844934347259084
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need.	3.435515072674745
Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives.	2.1319487327522184
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion.	2.6157893890473725
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	2.7700011901699004
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.	1.9974027373760734
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	2.558590768658323
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	2.3808890031282828
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.	1.9882104944527201
So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster.	2.2143073435760026
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.	2.639806237249868
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive.	2.221489909923552
But NATO ' s decision for military intervention and the KLA ' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.	2.223404045409287
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so.	1.934284555367588
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.	2.2394862051341584
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	2.842524809444198
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist!	1.555901896458843
That would seem odd to me.	2.294578740381791
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	1.701782740219451
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	2.155918895002853
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.	2.4671876762702203
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer.	2.8268100298943026
We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.431827994686372
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning.	2.8670308913948155
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	2.2568070168172487
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice.	3.628085715803727
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air.	1.9516279317162104
Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known.	2.0786505646035796
The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.	2.304593314168322
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	2.047338752590278
- (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party.	2.065744739548299
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	3.4491587529386187
This is no longer tolerable.	2.78400651595158
The facts are clear.	3.745008644195534
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.	2.522402813322011
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.	2.0086459899824054
That seems to me to be rather too long.	2.681852152395025
This means that this proposal ' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.	2.6371620826135893
(Loud applause)	1.0445699450791264
Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe.	2.2213113008461915
The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects.	2.3070694539647016
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State.	2.4068171568250922
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.	2.3197104883050494
Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.	1.6685173690571762
However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy.	2.627541335173698
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions.	2.742782128132684
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	2.047387123988905
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	2.2089384938780587
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring.	1.7618991838333768
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position.	2.7614639882897642
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.	2.807207812039929
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.	1.8826389865805306
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.	2.5411004135264306
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer.	1.92422224032157
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	2.9862267822990702
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe.	2.071874376056162
The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union ' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.	2.5714912531354703
Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen ' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement.	2.0409057213370208
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	2.6816131549525197
Relating to Wednesday:	1.3709693136098988
So who is this then?	2.437448014680301
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	2.071814248456588
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur.	1.9281267410718863
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.	2.1823126786818157
Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat.	1.6320100200955208
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.848462825470744
There is effective legal precaution.	2.476072315401671
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	2.4896950620870926
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	1.9189066697236137
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament 's next part-session.	2.224814836953039
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	1.5845987472212668
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.	1.9069576485703839
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.	2.3239741053048673
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	3.0257407903614633
I think that Mrs Lienemann ' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council.	2.947883564759672
What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union.	2.1504743803238937
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" .	1.7832235300208796
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions ' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission ' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission ' s relationship with the Council.	2.91323929183398
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.	2.231917096639769
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.	2.6746572314675623
We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations.	2.47091505919805
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	2.503665120322584
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens ' Amendment No 105.	2.325935801737638
In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either.	2.269981743529966
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone ' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	2.0107502707933884
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	2.980552765343483
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports.	2.1792053253474033
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.	2.3549107450316438
It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	1.936646976517217
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission ' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.	2.488929220066497
As far as we are concerned, they will be.	2.1133041414063567
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	1.997307348019705
Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time.	1.6385412705896254
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.	2.230091015714199
Is the Council discussing this issue?	1.8802415756909807
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes.	1.9217785756522008
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission ' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners.	2.741394042414241
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision.	3.1974785362990406
Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards.	1.9609855507429705
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	3.10078042917709
VOTE	1.0850475141586433
This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission.	2.4773492752367705
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	2.2212348240439463
We are seeking to implement best practice.	2.8248240614584064
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	2.852935637415536
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	2.1284604900092994
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	2.6979428732216593
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	2.737434662122283
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	1.9245141269359003
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	1.970163220055299
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.	3.3938259161591913
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise.	2.9188559908538143
But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission.	1.6697219576678892
The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms.	3.428205739289724
They want to see results.	3.0082426853891624
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
And because of the programme ' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	2.3027348301473807
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	2.209440523312725
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.	2.612288251261368
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David ' s Day.	1.7427397128339435
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate?	1.6465615010819505
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	1.9948526378496692
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe.	2.523001228024143
The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union ' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations ' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	2.5516727198056137
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me.	2.0476761167278217
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.	2.980453091549056
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	2.5414465740730527
One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully.	2.4070441209605264
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.	2.2739769621368264
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence.	2.677792556849792
A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.	2.6307729746082678
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services.	2.6236027826022155
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	2.300687949305431
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission ' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.	2.5297148523245885
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	2.543845577680366
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	2.651326960097181
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union.	2.4668164811162323
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.	2.1625895411475375
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	1.9665434660382648
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.	2.942207550565693
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	2.083857080803829
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts.	2.1669985295929988
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union ' s regional policy aims.	3.1010653375275403
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.	2.0146022173453715
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?	2.2793138944560036
And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries.	2.258810871472227
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	2.433737626181867
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	2.24392259733201
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line.	2.4833910032483146
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation.	2.418261559803742
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk.	2.577172095661386
From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact.	2.026795475811222
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	2.0608499699085847
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	1.650016162325888
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak ' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements.	2.363189517917861
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	2.184020666257532
The Austrian People ' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	2.4664750531928146
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance.	2.1361875257466756
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.8025257316374503
For this reason, I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level.	2.1094942770880047
Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate.	1.923534408488084
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	2.3831213293725853
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	2.1457856744102215
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	1.7564416618175105
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.	1.841590711829997
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States ' policy.	3.143180840900258
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism ' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	2.193683629343054
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	2.2314459403960063
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today.	2.337667693837879
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	2.7660340305156312
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	2.6989740305459415
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses.	2.4626512447188498
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	2.956012011779053
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.	2.845219288413112
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.	2.345303045261932
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.	1.964347888589099
Madam President, as you know, the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors, particularly in the French version.	2.289943413690843
Jörg Haider ' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth.	1.6462321922404581
This is very much on their minds.	2.811074788457429
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	2.8692209673185975
Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge Díez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa.	1.8500893892859378
Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe.	1.407139967041442
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome.	3.039869114689381
I have already appeared before the French Senate.	2.868617259924203
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	2.5673743611919657
We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level.	2.1518557925466744
Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.	2.004104553743501
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	2.072976411226242
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	2.2044333694441605
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate.	2.8602632376936303
Are you prepared to act upon it?	1.957862245880366
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough.	1.6598026043359857
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries.	2.001148026731112
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve.	2.6181705921429352
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.	2.1456900505525796
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.	2.2996194687843494
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit.	2.6237740269930447
I. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (5713/1999 - C5-0020/1999 - 1999/0803(CNS)	1.6355529405109204
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject.	2.1378884243763907
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2183945468114763
When six European countries have granted the right to vote, the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote, and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections, to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years.	2.273147923482467
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.	2.1790013271498943
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade ' (page 4).	1.8290984182803882
Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union.	2.4287095498953626
That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house ' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years!	1.8834210692706228
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do.	2.5233982178318697
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.	2.507834233540787
How many people found work?	1.9559366934825126
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	2.086167688831393
But we must support our tourism!	2.460372474564052
We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us.	2.291835765670782
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	3.467014973320972
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed.	1.6916008000727263
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy.	2.2844668450044696
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.	2.0752338846832448
If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure.	2.1605626778466327
In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges.	2.0002479265083015
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels ' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.	2.379734082199826
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.	1.6719074113469903
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	1.9191758578104583
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.902857139564
The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks.	2.829710431403913
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	2.8754583530594973
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary.	2.215006502232546
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	2.1396808331726307
But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control.	2.1869173139151137
I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers.	2.187448857335203
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.	2.238320293222685
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	2.6375222890967565
Tourism and employment	2.013785380763123
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected.	2.1232620903989896
Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better.	1.573768572260878
Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol.	2.19148467981164
It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%.	2.455158698209276
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty.	2.484958587509949
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	2.2881857721530805
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.	2.068320186216552
The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover.	3.3586506131162235
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	2.083316776038994
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success, or to say, "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation?	1.729000754317283
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission.	2.8980893377398345
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses.	2.831262223591035
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	3.147859833999547
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies.	2.087969568919603
In terms of balance, or should I say imbalance, I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict.	2.4798301571081383
Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these.	1.7199562856956658
Parliament cannot change these details.	2.115316081167501
The question which I therefore ask myself is this: has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area, how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence?	2.640239952600809
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	2.377516604168533
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation.	1.8647824923711187
Nevertheless, I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations, but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective, we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective.	2.8384287699767774
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas.	2.629142650343621
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	2.451927313735547
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.	2.436320922377433
Current programmes must be accelerated.	1.3687652819208336
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past.	2.7897742179282847
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.848462825470744
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	2.183726080782771
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	2.580798109623199
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	2.1062467991890244
As a political force, we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values.	2.4150249215217454
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	2.3298931274573373
The fact that the Council ' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group.	3.220388309607457
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.	2.7771465432133544
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	2.8795635210210677
) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll ' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time.	2.2182456872489946
We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"	1.9599895126631828
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one ' s friends unfortunately still exists.	2.1101053653511834
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction.	1.9615731344011476
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears.	2.031581054751491
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence.	1.89611999587036
Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects.	1.9325989118417393
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.	2.5401054071828404
Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law.	2.283244730953383
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe, and for the area of freedom, security and justice in particular.	2.4799747599275057
It is not only the targeted, specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport.	2.411543139786499
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	3.2876967035314366
The Commission ' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding.	2.3526317703588933
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria ' s integrity.	2.5275850575285115
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this.	2.4043193666407046
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	2.613340444939185
Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned.	2.227287401920631
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive.	3.4849105269853666
However, the EU ' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature.	2.5862541742717964
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	2.4108429107563185
Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon.	1.5671052933981455
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.	2.109477846116716
Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	1.954313729947351
Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made.	2.842552237481013
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect.	2.060420440341221
Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.8837823492513897
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.	2.584028526603383
We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report.	2.526691249983055
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.	2.0269351230576187
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too.	2.7492247040636415
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	2.4519214513365153
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	2.0102021539042805
The European Union ' s water policy is not starting from zero.	2.7858776748339285
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	1.7396607705390676
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure.	2.0114213904134517
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.	3.731753007960682
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission ' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	2.9107844652360537
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].	1.889965479575397
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	2.0052308792735194
As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases.	2.2972656369737545
The Commission ' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us, but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna.	2.796802014714617
And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region.	2.489380043075473
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	1.8872547221639584
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop.	1.7034321232442022
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation.	2.105197479084028
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements.	2.0515926391764037
We should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which, following the agreement, the European Parliament ' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it.	2.393342414120111
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	2.079779779632171
This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people ' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared.	2.177136834277049
(The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence)	1.523676903060755
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.	2.380156719721862
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.	1.779431824584868
Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.	1.5848862140082454
The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this?	3.135222560956898
In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague.	2.4031299269464474
Mr Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner ' s responsibilities, and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations.	2.1827833559604977
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis.	3.33823317643884
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.	2.013867600260865
Reality is obstinate.	1.2916356675202405
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this.	2.013523297370161
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us.	3.306755521731225
This is a key priority for us to focus on.	2.867443269992154
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	2.8031380912231727
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea.	2.423512873304557
Perhaps 'redundant ' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	2.5453299954231206
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition.	2.1049708872931716
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	2.632949406098042
Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation.	1.5264128014526221
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.	3.092369499747588
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.	2.1154673599891813
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.	2.84377867607563
And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard.	2.113774928496391
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc.	2.1640649241169965
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.	3.100880743014326
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	2.6058358023588646
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive.	2.2556798928261053
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.	1.732536029987835
It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.	2.542520891609852
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.	2.718226106699799
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action.	2.493205113538104
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.	2.1645587845177117
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.	2.6947334074595366
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.	2.224234676176078
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	2.4647825270807013
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).	3.211333337194739
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	3.0997732020514586
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	2.300097134878408
Union Economy (1999)	1.3334974992399695
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	2.8330835808434482
Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria.	2.4772724062340967
However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern.	4.120124887974653
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service.	2.650694955254319
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	2.764046640198987
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	2.0472767100875373
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council.	2.3749734781409932
That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility.	2.431832932485268
Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences.	2.4660067989383654
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.	2.312020598090085
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	2.796680371680973
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	1.9243982289379449
River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought.	1.9851322632817345
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	1.9267537481288732
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.	2.9386575252361307
We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions.	2.262671842296913
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse.	2.257918824125974
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	2.1830726155978115
Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you.	1.8158376155645848
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.	2.0074267305045828
In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry.	1.9470897431218044
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments.	3.248893871315076
The last question concerns the amount granted.	3.4009381599921054
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	2.484242075643631
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	2.022490379593356
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	2.718709406660247
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented.	3.382808245353556
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	2.1392660838828834
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.	2.0696179555537064
.	1.374839594702952
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders).	1.9359796699517748
Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months.	2.061603103174733
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	1.9149725733461367
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union.	2.444442684549094
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	2.6350145372532463
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	2.614621782564249
On the subject of human rights, I have received two proposals for additions: one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia ' and the other from the Group of the Greens, for an item entitled 'Pinochet ' .	2.259470406959369
The project has been long and problematic.	3.2238234195240842
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	2.387102928315347
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	2.329076715970987
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel 's relations with its northern neighbours.	2.0118691508664064
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.	2.7219996365247194
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	2.3597136809398744
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.	2.3158322695658025
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.	2.8988116871240965
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	2.5655056597059116
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	2.9018755499468583
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.	1.9048345372291169
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	1.634701977089202
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.	2.3525865522028497
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.	2.221995893265297
Two questions if I may.	1.730795703325806
I have heard many comments on the Commission ' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	2.3926643255547586
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon.	1.8647189934159545
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	2.1182999893575247
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	2.113420497008098
He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State.	2.2793374277772074
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.	2.793634643556822
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war.	2.1664960684614423
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.	2.2468669101864083
Press freedom in Angola	1.415846257957463
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States ' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	2.671312537090824
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe?	1.599096479159019
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts.	3.0705544720721885
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women.	2.181817024486781
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	2.0846618654588105
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.	2.93302582099245
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.	1.961157230506436
I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State.	2.063588926165415
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	2.0309925004318212
We will be organising and supporting actions including, in particular, the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.	2.560348094620583
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	2.0765855401246056
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply.	2.055203686211107
Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies.	2.5008951806035444
Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes.	1.9635811107311478
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.	2.52326091172804
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still.	2.0859209922797373
In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate.	2.7913102602677964
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	1.6703457253395755
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	2.4175569837757815
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	3.204055051318362
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.	3.1429162585378014
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!	3.047208879479937
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	2.416227106313292
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.	2.1577796513033998
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate.	2.2135182779590843
We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in "high quality", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water.	1.882098156376356
We have to remedy that.	2.9292993588283243
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.	2.444126757146064
It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour.	2.1681071082165735
Please rise, then, for this minute ' s silence.	1.8007627265148716
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.	3.857014923646424
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.	2.2440662189392264
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.	2.497045197887977
This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation.	2.6424893245791172
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	2.7733263668479644
I am aware of the Member ' s competence on these matters.	3.156559661698224
We are able but the rest of the female population is not?	2.4557681948515673
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries.	2.886438571447211
If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance	2.042451996529056
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	2.390470460993612
. Yes, Mr President, that is true.	2.3823324950348717
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters.	1.719302399182213
Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy.	1.4365114935680288
In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system.	2.4787130282490923
What are the Commission 's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	2.055406472417611
They have a much wider responsibility.	2.397284492293658
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.	2.07486463498843
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament ' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open.	2.1186776620199383
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey 's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	1.333992877237408
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten, Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict.	2.4030627212991464
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.	2.038809978016633
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.	2.1141285476922254
This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries.	2.255325232953412
There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk.	2.4297125625750944
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	2.0194968832011964
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	2.4387353134361214
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.	2.259027844968308
We insist on this.	3.4424699421904092
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	2.6887073733919364
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.	2.729464759886891
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.	2.431594531481888
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.	1.8374662143879499
In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	2.111810831830853
I naturally hope that the result of today ' s vote will be a good one.	4.308577089552113
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed.	1.4814965283985264
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.4511410500885278
They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources.	2.0641169863040547
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity.	2.3650229271463674
Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge.	1.7857987141328606
I would also like to say that the European Parliament ' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented.	2.575427462065796
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.	2.1030825542650953
I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect.	2.8638804469613195
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?	2.141167194679363
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test.	2.7902443090914213
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements . declared universally applicable ' (cf. Article 3(1) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	1.7596982085579245
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account.	3.339525590305138
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	3.1042958043532276
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	1.4904168030444693
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .	1.9802647012829802
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	3.029468886029603
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	2.3763059386013143
We are not doing a bad job of management.	2.474248082569357
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	2.730114783691946
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	1.887043039289911
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.	2.2265974048708075
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0142/2000) by Messrs Mrs Hautala, Mr Lannoye and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the strategic objectives for 2000-2005	1.8213751658112776
It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments.	2.1263153061963287
Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.	2.607349342509313
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens ' indifference to Europe.	2.2670065172625558
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue.	2.041228450355063
In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death.	2.4676058228886135
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?	1.6566517695777898
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	2.3344610490544673
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	1.8221270093088557
Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned.	2.1600185801076535
Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us.	2.138178846934667
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	4.104757113354326
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	2.277943986603454
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	2.4143817234436766
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement.	2.2828101231224474
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	2.40201878794525
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	1.914028678545423
I am talking about Milosevic.	3.1883928827285475
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	2.78162989334435
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above.	2.292807908042732
There have only been nine rejections.	2.4910476330261875
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model ' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	2.130675175553557
I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	1.9657301898298067
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds.	2.6448744479344097
When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage.	1.7422172811112853
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis.	2.584375533056609
This is a crucial goal.	3.235593912048758
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	1.9093161853549212
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	2.871710552819542
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.	2.619445467519176
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.	2.2462327817019103
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.	2.230240534363817
Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really.	1.655964758151691
For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive ' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject.	1.91246557730581
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	2.679223128305657
If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?	1.8481406788339512
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.	2.0724620722468474
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	1.766684984511795
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House, namely to introduce such an area.	3.0607790491492706
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society.	2.2844376786372065
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference.	2.3757982209145805
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.	2.9074516390522054
How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan?	2.2340582819935633
Personally, I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this.	2.253205310473329
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People ' s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission.	2.3959752498062215
The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues.	2.663198867781592
They need a 'European soul ' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.	1.8361014497255441
My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions.	1.784266920366117
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	1.8324622911090314
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate.	2.255003879142508
Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice.	2.2026595283997734
Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP ' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives.	1.7374579867475284
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	2.6064582483616157
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24	1.609697460921417
Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency.	1.992523089783258
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	2.6222016069415686
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	1.7616128484471496
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	2.9356218021460743
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake.	2.431250752058561
We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns.	2.645795903122326
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.	2.5493217576842815
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	2.3088104689284217
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities.	2.936945342961465
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently.	2.2021156796424037
Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery.	1.8500189832191039
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	2.5093810988690413
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy.	2.739656193570944
I find the opposite the case.	3.2297035588250367
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	2.8647208947439413
The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and "national interests" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions.	2.322173818717686
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.	2.3340055376233226
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.	2.0567622315979976
Who would want this to happen?	1.7972529333491525
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence.	1.9193178978713963
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts.	2.673223410196384
In the case of Turkey it is different.	2.737135333083609
Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament ' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers.	2.5016875988252796
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.	2.857555217721006
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital?	2.7240456036257803
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	2.8645600838252414
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document.	2.2988411610224686
In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security.	2.285415754284499
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	2.4210579738048197
However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado ' has disappeared completely.	1.976594834163438
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide.	2.2423661045746903
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.4716188326280957
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	2.300941648427464
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.	2.1635119875540454
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union ' s financial interests, and to OLAF ' s relationship with the national authorities.	2.177172721184932
Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points.	2.7711412055022495
Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules.	2.157102348472888
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)	1.9461496282198743
This is something we have borne in mind.	2.8984552142584405
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	2.025401049002197
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.	2.107492995183136
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.	2.0181437462883594
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy.	2.173464445843184
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.	2.1461944580464816
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	2.1255598928800934
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.	2.045831474750019
That concludes the debate.	1.9043701250864986
They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale.	1.7439818650838212
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.	2.407774144549455
During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession ' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.	2.383971777502868
For example, you did not go into antibiotics.	2.7246092676372156
Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	1.9364725237219433
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.	3.1301766572396956
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision.	2.3489846233605967
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	2.532488491828878
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report?	2.680419172773755
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable.	2.756313873211273
Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	1.9030262595834249
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward.	2.055218019320242
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	1.6575740170167683
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union ' s goals.	3.177102271712796
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.	2.4493959299712182
Our policies in Africa lack coherence.	2.248231198014926
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union ' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana ' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?	2.0128186600939495
All this is happening on a daily basis.	2.195189860069197
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF ' s job.	2.1481427416647083
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	2.3949647589339547
Fifthly, to publish an annual scientific, technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out.	1.615020128482598
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	2.839492739806642
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on her very serious work.	2.4659859704086546
. (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sjöstedt, for this question.	2.0961652427394917
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	2.014636472670661
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	2.0719006581040103
B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	1.8691879610218913
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration.	1.8672296385833587
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.	2.3789049252708288
We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.	2.1202636799225214
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself.	2.1638872532992273
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique.	2.8319916206375364
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections.	3.308470116948931
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	2.0337137423891445
On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last.	2.5593204204502777
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	2.223947616367768
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions.	2.370778602856753
However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government.	2.434413143066589
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge.	2.4245866614088434
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	2.437229792126119
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s reign of terror.	2.589660886707833
I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply.	2.718919879427298
At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today.	2.1526973795278406
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten 's report.	2.176536753496292
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	1.8704871582516525
Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.	1.9991159920272157
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.	2.72639469075193
Whatever Jörg Haider ' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this.	1.9148031033189377
This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean.	2.5216377484782218
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted.	2.761602269848525
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	2.7463953017464666
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	2.0363514694113007
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	1.8759564983200956
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need.	2.495205336449496
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy ' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	2.0967118862222356
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.	1.9167464604225213
Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)	1.67756249167492
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	2.1344846763384355
Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.	2.5537545882740287
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years.	1.9664383538353702
Thirdly, the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources.	1.9821923968271684
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7.	2.52688444968369
Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.	2.0455861182315873
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other.	2.4826218933076616
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.	1.6372303302866011
It is important that business has legal certainty.	2.1561876377111795
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	2.323552335320938
Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	2.0569809360328666
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage.	3.371557299637911
Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents.	2.2099621724663665
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?	2.7587482965741925
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy.	1.8665634771655681
How do these operate within the European Parliament ' s delegation to the ACP-EU ' s Joint Assembly?	2.7593194024992016
We estimate that the Commission ' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	3.335046898845447
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.	2.021114316125388
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	2.355124352620533
This is where we want to go.	3.6116876311997363
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.4511410500885278
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	2.6297213679067206
I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions.	2.187025933047652
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.	2.323942821026002
Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)	2.1260486726384067
This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People ' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it.	2.5932053955797967
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs.	2.0686002057813337
But we should not lower our standards too much either.	2.295401352383907
All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area.	2.024858302245096
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	2.404861785142207
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime.	2.2756855099490942
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	2.014104126234841
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.	3.1852810386753374
That, too, is a step forward.	1.6234431549207933
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	3.0039056794230508
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.	2.131610906959381
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals.	2.9500646679471845
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	3.391785732544309
The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text.	2.3721694058750944
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos ' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.	2.5039416918026642
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	2.333172369286664
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	2.519759935393274
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all, however.	1.786893725384253
That concludes the debate.	1.9043701250864986
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.	2.513727875996509
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.	2.4179754635202584
This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general.	2.5305289603178234
Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, which were implemented in the 1990s, were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and, along with other respective measures, they constituted the so-termed second pillar of the EU ' s rural development policy.	1.8607357896451808
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	2.615986262642283
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.	2.358165248593646
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	3.217668132983365
The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus.	1.999178310835589
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament ' s modus operandi.	2.85387335270334
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.	1.6862171968158797
Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management.	2.5170417721233793
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions.	2.175401243857066
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force.	2.2580323850398965
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	1.9683606423210396
Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	1.5062127028829306
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.	2.39699341633682
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations.	3.3200529619124213
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results.	2.7389202059383044
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.184851740693806
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.	3.3488289966924025
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.	2.6086695926329795
But I did notice a drop in alertness and when we debated the amendments of our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, you mentioned the Greens on their own in every instance.	2.1593269529862993
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	2.2063874422131535
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety.	2.706525251239848
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez.	1.7218292686042478
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.	2.313697138847652
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	2.3018815449547043
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	2.744217293538892
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	2.4145664313427853
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	2.3684883675413397
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth.	2.247165370804749
The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans.	2.2468575062771796
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan ' s very expert work on this report.	2.0902230865321125
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is.	2.4498355412325403
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.	1.9100184779945706
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.	1.9439644056478895
Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed.	2.5012642686885345
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	2.2124116716277307
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.	2.5178242970355256
(DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect.	2.309851923178776
This is wrong!	3.5698121786736605
Let us grab our chance.	1.9650807405484354
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.	2.668568323459788
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	2.236658026830203
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.	2.631410825202287
Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees, corruption, human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lomé Convention from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region.	2.058504877639779
On the second part of Mr Harbour ' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	2.3923418069743767
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	2.4928872173395895
Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement.	3.4946679763199278
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	2.5927443580922236
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe ' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	1.9827150332420345
In my grandparents ' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville.	2.1142052246237917
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature.	3.095015250624994
We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April.	2.3025865495756035
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	2.4494045331485332
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect.	1.4826699085179285
These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe.	2.2916869113833473
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.	2.4478078488492194
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.	2.8010132765550884
Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed.	2.365271115645628
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	2.8851134744817593
To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.	2.1431600223757394
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	2.41463641640503
First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base.	2.3705069164149495
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality.	1.7961534667891932
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	2.337167667404589
. (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market.	2.3651790839278797
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation?	1.8069741512378512
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology.	2.9353841691840015
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today ' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.	1.9893365960388365
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British?	1.9359957630017322
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe ' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	3.039936374399242
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	1.8921718872837028
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.	2.885510563053719
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	2.298661399292525
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe.	2.2585980672111057
Mr Swoboda ' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level.	1.954623316605687
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.	2.1673059632258878
This is an extremely risky strategy.	3.3214173672249117
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	2.6951328409016018
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.	1.8669384826926374
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	1.7338245163967025
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist.	2.235344375025327
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
The EU ' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment.	1.996926349875459
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	2.239090711771101
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	2.2908694184501615
Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, "Cocoon", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again.	1.8413172141739322
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.	2.4000280908683296
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered.	1.8187260516824149
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	2.840599688255368
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.	2.5697523771170907
Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue.	1.7925317459768528
This is unacceptable in my view.	2.4508636663461454
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.	2.1458173320387477
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding.	2.0341911140569984
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State.	2.3111751087525274
This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed.	2.390754138302892
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	2.4736467197258944
I believe that this issue is relevant to my question. Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening ' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections.	2.0406163697436637
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.546882890863002
Report (A5-0007/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)0003 - C5-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD)	1.721985937670716
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new; the Commission can approve these.	1.7815355600936824
Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour ' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel.	1.4760872050987253
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	3.460404328899615
In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption.	2.375082967379683
The Council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited.	2.9712866848080326
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office.	2.312417882390657
There must be an overriding economic interest.	2.2135825083345093
A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated, and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project.	2.2856371757494442
This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not.	2.3804099184793497
This objective deserves our total support.	2.7492838246618283
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	3.6001023713802724
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries ' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission ' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	2.2527843942973385
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	2.439735852880018
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	3.5554979168867336
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.	2.809889470259401
However, it is not under threat from Europe.	2.971795048452757
Here too there is at least some progress.	1.9427222732862108
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	1.8134543292682952
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	2.557073928616577
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.	2.3547701202069047
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	2.2361412554016726
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	1.8128758303726933
My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma.	2.1605899657536463
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	2.6540553536976255
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.	2.2680291277203537
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs.	2.1846502182217433
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.	1.9328347879795649
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.	2.2648063274593926
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.	2.1620571532455197
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them, particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country ' s own pre-accession strategy agenda.	2.862570387021958
Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved.	1.9355258122083068
The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.	2.3550750335805555
So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive.	1.8911928094107995
Böge report (A5-0023/2000)	1.3619054849432088
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	2.692766967113816
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.	2.1936795987691093
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988.	2.0742644785731326
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK.	2.3170464596822886
All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required.	2.2018367650143946
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?	2.5688965978030276
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	3.4215982994729783
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	1.9183540708623634
Senior citizens are always on holiday, all year round, from 1 January through to 31 December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year.	1.894527593410753
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.	2.203668929300399
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	2.1069705021019822
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	1.9781037144172622
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	2.173628984957416
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics. Because women have to deal with different realities.	1.9532057620820953
They cannot therefore be approved.	2.366723158020173
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	2.341515958187102
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.	2.156322988933277
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated.	2.4830032903185546
(Loud applause)	1.0445699450791264
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	3.12009418894757
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area.	2.053651300788856
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	2.0178183181162597
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?	1.8967059018199233
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.	1.905580979638947
Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures.	2.1679673898397627
In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans.	2.125048208117267
I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised, particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks.	2.73235080213343
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	1.9860819794123423
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	2.405879883921108
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained?	1.9697236741790958
Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe.	2.6405194554421847
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	2.693602010068089
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament, and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests, but also of business.	2.5522445541025287
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	2.5972619663336753
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!	2.677219685693743
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this.	2.4809317897167085
That is not what we want to do in Europe.	3.22367901919918
In this first speech, I would like to share with Parliament the Commission ' s view of the most important events in 1999.	3.4762837825219033
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.	2.382306754994647
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE.	2.406281160729225
There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society.	1.9412680797700115
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	2.202057074536093
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	2.250827013685013
Women are systematically raped.	1.7467609491518017
They have all been available on the Commission ' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested.	2.454280953396772
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997?	1.9078531754488055
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.	1.6852093189032455
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	2.272757584011245
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises.	2.7942621578484297
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.	2.7966324716042954
As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval.	2.6666068839112054
Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.	2.4842700640406727
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union ' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	2.1897463330988898
Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries ' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed.	2.0579979995469815
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.	1.8377954917818002
However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State.	2.2416215777566535
Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity.	2.379767999170232
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	2.21518237062118
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	3.8232179202162375
(More than twelve Members of Parliament rise to their feet) (Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.6131147385713491
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.	3.239685600109491
The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States.	2.923958971053321
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	2.290380070267163
For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.	2.4064151709267905
Where is the beef?	1.595419164531797
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.	2.2480634597430917
Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types.	3.0964315609880426
(FR) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle, the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP, i.e. their former colonies.	2.1959328005076317
Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible.	2.443195860122429
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	2.4925880189473095
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	2.6483677936818313
By now they are far away.	2.2147208441890727
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	2.177578436400379
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.	2.539059596673164
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	1.612707625999842
Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate.	2.1244554894698378
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	2.2042781230808
Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information.	2.171290195867116
In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.	2.3733344967604078
This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing.	3.3774592770589322
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	2.1291831312025837
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests.	2.184092065637221
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	1.9124351577559975
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	2.405446297758682
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all.	2.260567895498555
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.	3.3080706036850036
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	2.8611250268393915
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	2.9430663856893124
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	2.2412638942799887
They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc.	1.9926215583669398
But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels.	2.4107840337107813
As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report.	1.9176863166657163
Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground.	1.945792073681196
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	2.367112018860382
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.	2.6983484360149856
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.	1.940229329363361
As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme ' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this.	2.5256557331307894
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	2.7613891355078017
Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström.	2.10105333997227
We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions.	1.8907324073362695
However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals.	3.1426661305121493
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	1.776358890771715
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again.	2.252799137530986
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	3.2349241259633246
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.	3.222001997400453
In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.	2.561791133977587
Mr President, I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level.	2.587710542835626
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.	2.8354780078804085
I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution.	2.1299920847235096
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about.	2.6804308660025713
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.	2.476486833973562
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	2.641315064321208
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	2.5018343074817944
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	2.661340376275711
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	3.017533210228546
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	1.7235691209671213
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.	2.4392218649543858
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	2.8676695514305917
I hope you will help us.	2.973739590608826
The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.	2.480269001547779
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.7737084791327264
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned.	2.5604065385037527
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.	2.8422594790423785
Let us just consider for a moment.	1.9114974434921077
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.	2.7926684667602433
Do we have any figures?	1.958413967258253
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?	1.4797710398268171
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.	2.3382953272276095
Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts ' definitions.	1.6339160544022473
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty?	2.5435079131014895
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications.	2.600635954981179
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	3.312361206686695
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	1.8227377289853348
Its legislation is to apply equally to all, to large and small countries alike.	1.7757589191968772
Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis.	1.9935378381910145
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	2.563129332416858
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.	2.043290412753531
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.	2.2742426929838886
Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it.	2.3899935572901367
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( 'Culture 2000 ') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD).	1.7286990792363126
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika ' s owners?	2.217964674283425
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.	2.5898718658175164
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):	1.793627914817911
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	2.1081575930971215
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	1.940294468439589
We all know the picture.	2.9637279844278215
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries ' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe.	2.091352337209664
We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels.	2.2667052656232896
What do they see?	2.570048710986431
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.	2.6241487330433064
The directive remains in place.	3.0863573295542976
Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too.	1.8174093783065552
(The President declared the common position approved (as amended)	1.842521707257071
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.	2.0767023751152585
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.	2.377520287380954
Water is a prerequisite for human life.	1.6816557907082366
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that.	2.2705721241092105
Let us point out that Parliament ' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	2.616137926944043
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.3863496922880096
Now, finally, the EU ' s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget.	2.4261846362406354
All the foreign troops, including therefore the Syrian forces, must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council.	1.9641206496100787
The tourism market is by definition a flexible market; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light, with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work: remember that 50% of employment, especially in southern countries of the European Union, is done on the black economy.	2.3268217290344073
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles.	2.2761720025088046
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty.	2.5970140798867614
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	2.267491954495939
Firstly, private investment must be assisted.	2.177065194379788
The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.	2.3280112909315704
In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" .	2.06582949608063
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	2.5605729818109193
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest.	2.0263564847069304
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened.	1.7493637889821239
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.	2.3273359835599416
Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report.	2.669698185244466
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons.	2.1560671583422892
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"	1.9461284554836549
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	2.0696505138944907
It would weaken a key element of European policy.	2.5297523132165836
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities?	2.1686915534211297
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly.	2.4554725015450325
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.	2.0917936510035857
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.	1.9230188492546643
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	2.148297516989823
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.	2.5198531814648866
It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States.	2.07636634803662
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	2.318764389061872
Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	2.2760077188364907
However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change.	2.2081744414799203
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages, but have not been able to check all of these, and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type.	2.667342452900147
I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner ' s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.	2.1485336876252767
In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.	2.198921194737549
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars.	2.6530540166052723
Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude.	1.7087671906676558
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	2.219038326928744
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one ' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity.	2.4233437645672717
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse.	2.5859190909233383
The declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen.	3.3051803008076397
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	2.6801754208998054
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.	1.8422055455237294
I hope that we can thrash this out.	3.1155591988007942
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council.	2.13622344099739
However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater.	1.8849048032602866
Madam President, with apologies to my friend, Enrique Barón Crespo, I should like to speak against this proposal.	2.1911722677255385
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe.	2.6903895852487842
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.	2.2246827230835784
However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these.	2.3050015699728075
That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.	1.9711017077104689
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead.	2.409598465145823
In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly.	2.2847981194750524
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.	1.9698943848332005
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report.	2.574873857857798
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider.	2.5870120261155702
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.	1.5700599147460221
I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy.	2.5754023910401096
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.	1.5279545274777655
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks.	1.6287892055159483
The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union ' s and the European Parliament ' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction.	2.6816004266802627
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.	3.5482704545200296
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it.	2.310036213381114
In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature.	3.2014271614260053
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.	2.1221774349137688
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	2.009022781131481
Like everybody in this House, I want freedom, justice and security. I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion.	2.376269868516615
Disparate actions are not effective.	1.3759604943345454
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.	1.9222600877573466
For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies.	2.108375760777623
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries.	1.6828612511983092
In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States.	2.268906329574797
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	2.001244934190384
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.	2.060713057058747
In our opinion, the Commission ' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	3.2754800874533254
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	2.138900276224422
As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification.	2.950006299609127
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price.	2.4128741575061863
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many.	2.643953291016975
Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.	2.005664213983791
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean ' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	2.4442257915443464
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.	2.5866718312839874
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	1.9791605156369823
I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution.	2.2924637283008984
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.	2.2579199774806678
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.	2.2200858611266465
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.	2.1255662413732552
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	2.138607523394147
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.	2.1599850464480923
Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations.	2.4748568773353394
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	2.7092284799593225
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	2.715938690617096
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.	2.5642171504225053
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	2.7075111874087128
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.	2.0893565172895294
We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission ' s initiative.	2.486914835551935
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	2.4692696800931713
However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations.	2.0910957039758946
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.	2.485661372317504
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not.	2.286102070016653
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	1.9066838244452802
There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo.	2.6941790810142625
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	2.0954508524231357
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.	2.377073678945221
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.	2.1199289575207922
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.	2.1122726113880232
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	1.7948190380897007
At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity.	2.0222852768371995
One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated.	2.214009534161628
As far as Mr Papayannakis ' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	1.9140022961854697
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland.	2.117229348159029
There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high.	2.0193221848202234
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	2.33139071060186
Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward.	2.104643967540069
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter.	2.467112608425282
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings.	1.8699465318927062
This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.	2.388073875875317
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry.	2.95793232649288
Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails.	2.509665809550611
It is clear that is not acceptable.	3.2484202261343285
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	1.9233313993765768
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	1.9414116099411494
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	2.1132698395527276
This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission ' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States.	2.2022999198980204
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission ' s proposal more stringent.	4.0078918327781325
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon.	3.250721509229238
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	1.6454341696129484
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom, security and justice.	2.2924667488862527
This issue is extremely serious.	2.7748991348686554
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	2.419309641596454
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes.	2.627928368720887
This is no longer tolerable.	2.78400651595158
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech.	2.3266109098321692
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	2.1065620365162805
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States?	1.9506694799971098
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process.	2.2954297906483205
The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud.	2.7961365633755806
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.	2.1043100392561263
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard.	3.352686216260052
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	2.444506672229835
Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable.	3.42858391113919
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement.	2.6736281119810434
I hope the House will understand that.	2.9750359362150274
Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.	2.3417301450875643
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe ' s development process.	3.267903993163744
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.	1.743475464381442
Nevertheless, to avoid the customary circus, which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council, maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years.	2.012308957925355
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	2.332043640353117
Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales.	2.0500979672096444
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively.	2.1018290613141346
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter.	3.056596757285515
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	2.236325901615079
This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.	3.5044142629614576
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator.	1.859248843734957
Why are there no fire instructions?	1.9533157146598896
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.	2.5708053972357945
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	2.5401232043854907
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival.	2.1421760801164695
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	1.8987628951409858
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.	2.1842655778077233
In today ' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious.	2.713650563990639
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	1.832766173360001
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur ' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.	2.4431916649147407
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.	2.2330156122562976
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	1.7738873170770042
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.	2.4613048150791568
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.	2.55398755574984
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.	1.8663698119645853
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	2.880353987312501
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one ' s own country.	2.4783483688171497
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.	3.3066315225970286
The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and/or environmental degradation.	2.2899052563231064
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	2.7067503127642185
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.	2.4463413547613437
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	3.22146343596444
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.	3.4652741755149687
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture.	2.110648504743791
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	2.306288414050335
And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary.	2.9199731396261024
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.	2.6623784088675815
Mr President, this proposal aims to incorporate into Community law an ICCAT recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from June 1999, but which only reached this House at the end of last year.	2.0272796650808593
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack ' s very emotionally-charged contribution.	2.3050975770386306
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.	2.4192598365588824
Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century.	2.8625103158600953
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.	1.7456346577839619
I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service.	2.1875355847038778
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.	2.1478186238318897
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	2.054089331958612
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee ' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks.	2.530674365956069
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.	2.0928532237035156
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned.	2.781812439326519
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	1.83083188121007
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	2.2528367200268247
In addition, I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.	2.0690789586109606
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	2.5465581181111125
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law.	2.2601238639025003
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet.	2.6103264152615857
Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland.	2.191853941212962
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.	2.829189610092874
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.	2.231262595849827
We are all entitled to clean drinking water.	2.6172976799817365
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.	2.161515705354973
It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term.	2.147898932182302
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner?	2.132771973484891
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.	2.147647900574602
The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	3.003662626271208
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community.	2.6071154030624966
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	2.4908784314840324
Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector ' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively	1.6035260571975818
Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well.	2.325546161371316
I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.	2.8551173844617432
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council.	2.7100070110832704
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	3.481767018695711
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.	3.2516647770564875
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	1.998020308814834
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	2.165293899467616
However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans.	2.499671057319459
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive.	2.281887351757684
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive.	2.221831843262909
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.	2.705706437381964
I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned.	3.0732928771110632
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	2.802446729855491
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	1.9689139073172612
And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations.	1.7576486532773756
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament ' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission ' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	2.514879523346113
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.	2.5530012456452695
It is for life.	3.0627192339879397
A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences.	2.2281610219436128
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.	2.495361006783963
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone.	3.0686507077489558
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	2.5355825749348297
All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict.	3.064444231392629
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	3.66296718681685
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.	2.6935646442006576
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.	4.127152644512283
So what are we to do now?	2.1290971160997616
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office ' s business abroad?	2.8192204198898883
This applies to every country.	2.654492403972114
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question.	3.346908349851522
From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest.	2.0195520559222353
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution.	2.086042274660449
The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable.	2.143730401848371
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	1.9124221988859775
The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998.	2.551290967781688
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.	3.0275780026515324
Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino.	3.2093332304868087
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.	2.1835388035646184
Question No 7 by (H-0035/00):	1.8677029329163262
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union ' s policies.	2.5719863754410373
Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset.	1.690849657840073
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.	2.240712388857527
Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it.	1.896098306895673
VOTE	1.0850475141586433
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves.	2.6820766455225806
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	3.898770422560722
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo	1.666021815039739
As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation.	2.1085948089247837
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	2.2628247875115868
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	2.2679016691396447
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	2.2563506057439926
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.	2.0888011687163166
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans.	2.1957830454327705
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	3.190849178626459
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts.	2.1221559088880038
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	1.5531689106117623
I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society.	2.410025355720061
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries.	2.3000470594226066
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.	2.758890568443258
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.	2.309054207334479
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.	1.8862089007624998
We should not be too masochistic.	3.507406321214384
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.	1.8020938985514516
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	2.5980304791435773
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	2.14322105050482
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water.	2.042022064568848
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission ' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	2.290146096015274
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	2.321944562165732
. I accept that.	2.3865794707262733
It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation.	2.267238668482596
(SV) This is a very important question.	2.9192569084161595
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	2.0784246557168506
Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.	2.3325375288574306
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	2.6331861796745897
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.	2.0325741964029156
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution.	2.9542694198890533
I do not believe that it is anybody ' s intention to do so.	2.564900063154931
The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind.	2.401780932959652
I remember your predecessor ' s speech five years ago.	2.7556167665405495
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget.	2.8657624570068525
In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises?	2.282011525278369
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	1.9225889884014953
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank.	1.4671754887331419
Mr President, at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt, our rapporteur.	2.3794284539269697
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years.	2.115519291350538
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy.	2.3905865504210353
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year 's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs.	1.9931922512190279
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed.	2.381327778577219
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements.	2.661130959201061
At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system.	2.05463294684155
Subject: Commission 's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	1.977900808097393
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed.	2.497771119058657
In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons.	2.765301437156699
I am anxious to know how effective the EU ' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	2.4342649783822945
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset, it should, in my view, demonstrate this in practice.	2.513529506948704
But the Member States failed to cooperate.	3.389871350537474
What has become of it?	2.4528039913048207
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	1.8946280356748602
In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product.	2.1120693188356103
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect.	3.326498604869098
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.	1.992639379035998
They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours.	1.8064716829272207
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.	1.8310799612665491
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	3.1647557128442063
Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context.	3.5029789503648443
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.	3.2545261054169856
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006.	2.521290634043888
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	3.471593209383466
The human rights policy is also too selective.	3.2107205598109902
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union ' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	2.6484792436121283
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency ' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	2.2502317978984303
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent.	2.046943365580073
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	2.9320777928396526
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	3.330096765262309
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe ' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all.	2.4320767042537104
In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case.	2.0421220417032817
Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in.	1.8450159955910206
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked.	2.037127255965084
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.	1.5873248581177584
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	1.8730872838912154
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	2.3931692863479643
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	1.9240673263301402
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	2.3423104812662348
If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens.	2.205619167779455
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.	2.5669558249818025
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	2.153216482565077
First part	2.627314154140763
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.	2.7114624526500934
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse.	3.0580838673604283
The next item is the report A5-0039/2000 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland, with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS).	1.9507959131405
The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	2.163696792885799
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	2.46407113025767
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	2.052137892979724
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	1.9732677191907755
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	1.8464468534402956
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.	3.3331452581419914
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	2.2812960664159854
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	2.1397953661214153
Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth.	1.7982179819190565
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	2.592158452170414
There is no contradiction between the two.	2.1508745557963227
In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy.	2.60358464649107
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.457652188634284
One of the EU ' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	2.79661005200323
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.	1.5638682062751939
Deviating from the Council ' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	1.8569099612067113
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point.	2.926010449190765
This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates, financed by the European Union, the CSF.	2.873353235013585
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.184851740693806
"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."	1.4980855583636412
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.	2.7961309951864575
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	2.4210911814983485
However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested.	2.6179912326563253
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	1.8538360444140014
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	2.30429320225884
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	2.0405467386526275
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.	2.2630296932597638
This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity.	3.2645656876071776
Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate.	1.755600804155018
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	2.6557049936137904
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	2.161062640553794
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.	2.2700772730853185
We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions.	2.3943114840271136
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.	2.898626683825701
Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage.	1.490148103626061
Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes.	2.1850940835419252
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.	2.4519792926624833
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	2.129588582165943
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	2.106093087610094
In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process.	2.5129702695045832
Mrs Theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.	2.3294537285240313
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic.	2.7690218149985286
As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team.	2.1516163346805146
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	2.0421494812450964
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	2.102120475724375
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.	2.770423420597151
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry ' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?	2.6067253988907013
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.	2.237164399455557
According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea.	1.7092927231252661
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.	1.5883336183466137
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	2.0177557378656408
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped.	1.8821432398136817
I think they should have.	3.7011347884185812
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13.	1.9648054305992375
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	1.8583415771874472
However, it is important, at least in Finland, as a sustainably used, slowly renewable energy source.	2.1014787670141373
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	2.1517622838428183
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	2.200820939011271
The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences.	2.630547668411517
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission 's proposals.	3.6260287406600087
Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy.	2.452309349284726
It is an imperative.	3.1504624808345794
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	2.283410363894903
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.	2.534269666660239
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President.	2.5911791274465656
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?	2.229818207882697
We have taken note of this.	2.7495280303816148
Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.	1.55232023265362
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	2.146447611424734
Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe.	1.4621410470525003
Mr President, it is pleasing that, despite certain delays and problems, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria.	1.952851778539704
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support.	1.9956046141864294
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?	1.9568510478575534
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and, in common with others, express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence.	2.7537578596783265
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	1.6489942579984003
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	1.6083629221982925
We can take action against this; it is possible.	2.4764943176636045
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings.	2.1651097964345585
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	2.6553689043338835
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.	2.173579488664734
As far as we, the Council presidency, are concerned, we will continue to follow these developments very closely, and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter.	2.061737417731143
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	2.8434701132120295
Question Time (Council)	1.8469571105543827
I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition.	2.095003562678693
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.	2.0759346615407015
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged.	2.0117389304221254
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	2.3345641863043385
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	2.167017738098214
(Loud applause)	1.0445699450791264
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission ' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse.	2.3191942440439957
Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy.	2.2569527574170487
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	1.7362076292959392
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4.	3.1551323151200372
The matter of the European Union ' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.	2.935655823214264
Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content.	2.2654040841426033
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	2.7307949132638933
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	2.38253900757371
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.	2.216405169681373
So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation.	2.195930814041315
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.	2.215612701303997
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.	3.5905773397201894
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	2.3079411305575652
Mr President, behind the report, which is an honest one, by Mrs Attwooll, which we shall vote for, we see the European fisheries policy. It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move.	2.293832691191807
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	2.4477690347649554
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?	2.0309566381742052
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	2.7716574311518274
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .	1.9274158392369736
Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr Désir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.	1.6997223845508236
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council.	2.9342127399806865
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.	2.4869871089676865
It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable.	1.9886495805518543
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	1.7591085742025938
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition ' .	2.1616831844394695
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	1.9752659097940164
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?	2.448211728475936
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission ' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	2.1661073017492547
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary" activities.	2.150080138960501
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	1.7902411817833292
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses.	2.6692909291722304
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	2.830461998246364
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	2.1094318798564986
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.	2.4318553059655454
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me.	2.794381262928627
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	2.2306142551640593
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	2.328721778053251
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	2.928133829320962
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties.	2.4160017685713298
In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient.	2.4976139282873597
By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors.	1.752240691823825
In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following:	3.035086125686763
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	2.7503175319436854
We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members.	2.3522589607452766
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer.	2.501509381413958
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined.	2.061425257473361
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	2.743716785717359
This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place.	2.6530179140825867
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	2.1675640874974347
I have taken note of your comment, Mr Speroni.	2.605678056284767
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	2.7899303215773434
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	1.8832103040839379
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.	2.4713421128724957
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	2.267360454378648
We already have a directive.	3.296061901496618
Report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)	1.6745038316918925
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.	2.551303529323936
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds.	2.9825114310116003
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?	2.4534255460475154
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears.	1.973541301305175
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.	2.5780045640924274
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.	1.7815267809546007
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.	1.9878362660008309
One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy ' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people.	2.1648261338252968
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.	2.4263107650414457
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?	2.251504155718418
We would, in this way, violate democracy.	3.302354606529458
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.	3.185859789694227
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	2.5304073128886437
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet.	2.1643791119203915
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	2.6190311719982273
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.	2.085113455565904
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	1.7004742506417272
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	1.9478224616154494
Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper.	2.1567728200770055
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome.	2.5801009196760436
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading.	2.445191951797221
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	1.86455480553141
President.	1.2448676067253313
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.	2.4935819182503915
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	2.1726030504702964
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate?	1.9648649956821007
It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies.	2.793564500699542
Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year, approximately 200 000 died in wars.	1.669018015362724
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units.	2.220044539290001
We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future.	2.1679423803790407
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.	1.4014502630252603
. (DE) Madam President, I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification, because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations.	2.314951946223148
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed.	2.1513040158363648
It is not easy, indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing, that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties.	2.3477476780356903
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.	2.118468793408445
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)	2.079485962107321
We are also committed to the Security Council ' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.	2.598535507860297
Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain.	1.7784353856964858
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.	2.978942196607405
In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers ' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions.	1.7865075394431806
So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this.	2.16382233487143
I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular.	2.2301199134991516
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions.	2.8103191670347893
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	2.112250351032691
That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic.	2.391811490764986
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola.	2.8804201866165586
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter.	2.3424430883881016
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man ' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	2.279184064129394
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	2.027758045688081
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.	2.62110628329582
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway.	3.7677751384631026
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.1857577252002707
Soon, in May, the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union ' s external relations.	3.257019270432425
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole.	2.526418116051244
Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure.	2.2995374406145572
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.	2.016259868261624
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.	1.7571141772460142
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.	2.0616518785735396
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen.	2.726282276833036
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future.	3.007567915011861
This is a creative initiative, which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue.	2.161590555004417
Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis.	2.1414336363903277
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament ' s prerogatives and competences.	2.771497685198642
This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution.	2.0800373646309276
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	2.6175482238021055
It is up to the Commission ' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach.	3.086064762888365
This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries ' own policies.	2.2491896183206985
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.	2.1013971864241245
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities.	3.0703964045061447
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	2.054350514470987
Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors.	2.036688315949794
An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination, and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen, Patten and Poul Nielson.	1.889575647227763
First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years.	2.3608558636430503
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3647183468043427
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.	2.435664506411565
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement.	2.4417796110203245
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	2.639532532433683
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.	2.2453054141888393
I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers ' view that this is such an interesting debate.	2.6041703228835824
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.	2.6585389748830615
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy.	2.59504214919371
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.	2.5427688972150517
We are discussing coherence here.	3.026231568428559
Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union.	1.7914962793537823
I would therefore urge the Council ' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide.	2.697592700501941
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.	2.4225110968367654
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	3.216113262049027
The second sentence should read: '., weshalb diese Hilfen ' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und ' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen ' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).	1.7631309002452673
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency ' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.9343965951372444
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	2.048726121096396
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution.	2.6738602578004618
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	2.334157652025124
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.	2.6413081652537995
Some of these parties, despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic, adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right, either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy, if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment, and generally making their lives more difficult.	1.6307436093770014
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?	2.1904147281414486
Calling under these circumstances, as he does in paragraph 20, for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House.	1.6243536354121728
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.	2.731821890472013
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House ' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.	2.4235116844517264
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	1.8478669027279842
The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible.	2.151151807322018
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.	1.8302405890507487
In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.	1.8601189470703758
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole.	2.489342511041706
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	3.2656701192027757
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	2.45276687181851
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	2.210614907816217
Women and children were beaten.	1.8325039619153736
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.	2.454050722783881
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	2.5426856335750507
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	2.3982090771894726
Please excuse this very legal answer.	1.695385240265935
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	3.2616069350883947
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy.	2.2028614305182623
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.	2.2418120630601135
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway.	1.9424193370353606
Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.	2.674841102067038
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	2.0811098753731763
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	2.203571574583195
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	2.5478398355215477
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.	2.1145779120671837
Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council ' s draft directive.	2.7121486084224333
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	2.8511598358765995
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services ' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	2.7744295188733554
That is not guaranteed.	2.6321614908253164
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership, which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.	1.9762867394877996
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations.	2.6678514799785376
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it.	3.120049877164347
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	2.2586019730457645
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	2.3007581833119732
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far.	1.9636056543735287
I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given.	2.149792703872085
It is certainly not my task to judge other people ' s alliances but if the People ' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people ' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.	1.9119274269519586
I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie.	1.781460770928955
Here improvements should be made.	1.8547847548100924
Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.	2.1259429421216116
Forgeries are big business.	1.261917550612768
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.	2.257176416710068
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	1.9801123569745966
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	1.88126977959695
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.	2.4645763507459093
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	3.005216434685184
That is all to the good.	2.4681384842848257
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	2.3449342402310536
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0136/2000) by Mr Queiro, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Berthu, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	2.0681802753162906
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	2.693685740248432
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society.	2.1045628509343084
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	2.4725316469898706
We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson ' s report.	2.3445703153286104
The challenge is to make the system the very best.	3.4091668066919345
Nevertheless, I must make it clear that all these actions will, of course, have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries, so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	2.0630275801661266
This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.031358719116932
Have we achieved results?	1.7863935965316748
Madam President, may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry.	1.730735193115735
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	2.1690773854192154
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	1.7656097157926194
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.	2.5944041451775686
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	2.5300205300128047
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	2.26657387923178
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people.	1.7517151403732734
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.	2.1217103817989966
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	2.044852211592892
In our opinion, the Union ' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity, not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs.	2.399737586328494
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible.	2.502753071074963
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	3.8609664167298874
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	2.333232320234422
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address.	1.9985835167727033
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	2.4468592309913375
The honourable Member raised the question.	2.8937194471238095
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country.	2.3237320226854616
This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States.	2.410310880947677
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.	2.981603328780216
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission ' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	2.648934378299061
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.	1.9100703261403418
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?	2.0058302342814476
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances.	2.210169538996647
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	1.6747601378619097
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.	2.596615304676139
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	1.9629056963561158
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	3.4384674828072312
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	2.0521550082513142
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally.	2.2017036126193723
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.	2.0312901044028164
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey ' s intransigence.	2.016330610232909
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	1.9290691315949533
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.	2.6670144456250364
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.	2.7040028823532105
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations ' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	2.486255630563497
For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal.	1.8297350320149206
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	2.5996179276744065
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	3.393653416538743
I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.	2.8462479657698108
In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property.	2.0853365924338134
It is nothing less than legal torture.	2.5595377330064975
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources.	1.9127401915705107
You still have not finished that agenda.	2.3119330981831987
The first principle means creating a new 'pact ' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside ' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside ' s recreation value.	2.158637868394971
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	1.8706588990175275
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in.	2.2337504369174614
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.	2.4591401621943123
Proposal for a joint resolution on coherence of different Union policies	1.6550044721855672
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	2.4962834713964845
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market.	2.170470611560915
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	1.8389755298452612
In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements.	2.1295197987337082
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community ' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	2.3423268418669565
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate.	2.401447977005185
That is why he deserves special mention!	2.1516101249421467
There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising ' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy ' are not used.	1.697981376125236
In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position.	2.705612027388357
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report.	3.23334243862421
The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed.	2.283150099415969
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	2.250404727641215
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements.	3.037271264159836
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	1.8916294113015664
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	1.6491354067636632
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.	1.812895890606138
That concludes the explanations of vote.	2.157494373612503
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.	1.9551567149134463
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.	2.3973326973200173
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	2.7075480204103273
The newspaper reports were misleading.	3.104698780080199
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.7536095963931
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	2.3345189251883203
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	2.581206993054317
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	2.2621610783848722
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	1.975319186444793
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	2.763258653275456
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	2.0896008401952884
In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.	2.037198368057644
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.	2.1759439531130647
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	2.312340437119224
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	2.002814572473619
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.	2.5602002991738844
The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108.	1.5120250669823687
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.	3.4864728648401813
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	2.8559599992074243
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	2.0723572866002344
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.	2.0151928300213338
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.	2.5144247270165763
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently.	2.2780329445025256
Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed.	1.6362572723142248
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	1.8469811285875208
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion.	2.322552199578791
That does not apply to Austria alone.	2.3986638975073458
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO.	2.003545216970283
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services.	1.6441183644705353
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	2.4362314874588145
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	2.3879766672185974
To grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of Europe, it is worth pointing out that in my own country, Greece, a country that attracts tourists, over the past four decades, during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over-concentrated in the major urban centres, the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed.	1.9924181372704473
As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.	2.719757995884518
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	1.997069941907418
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners.	3.088520956872952
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.	2.1077094858254375
At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations.	1.9137232051254862
Water and air surround us everywhere.	1.6066739184738945
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	2.050933072644024
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.	2.479180520101659
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	2.954408052807002
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	2.28990546118736
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS).	1.6156954859975292
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report, which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated.	2.489181305290069
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected.	2.858089610449519
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen 's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy.	2.460441738016753
That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.	2.3954219905398886
But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold.	2.050483904644832
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	1.8760035105204933
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	2.8645718798531528
We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast.	2.047075402138186
Since then, the victims ' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	2.0441096665124228
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy ' s turn.	2.3351587369447806
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.	2.0883370345208796
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level.	2.1477543508305836
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?	1.9649194743716256
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	2.828882620623524
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	2.026173870852875
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence.	2.990005569942984
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	2.1008569298530233
Parliament voted in favour of this text.	2.871141329325015
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament ' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	2.46061799170237
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	2.0931346064058896
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.	2.4629034924548856
They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.	2.160321819199548
Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle.	2.1189976077485215
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.	2.1729956040136438
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument.	1.8092637002939684
Could the Commissioner answer two questions.	1.7433280211610764
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication ' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	2.5900563619183745
Mr Alavanos, I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited.	2.729155610414619
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	2.4069777616515173
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	2.1194145997407565
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	2.8135635674320434
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	2.005353391356434
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers ' needs continues.	1.991427918077154
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	2.200851989946623
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	2.3899429917489963
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.	3.2379346299473406
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve.	3.3516067258832836
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	2.32816050924519
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	2.442584932987157
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.	2.217329374262465
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products.	2.6241019126840666
In terms of comitology, Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part, insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned.	2.144085779636278
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again.	3.587019519462177
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	1.6329425090171443
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.	2.3191073808476665
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
The present programme ' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow ' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions.	2.16585893288952
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification.	2.6449270999355776
On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women.	1.8573389864894938
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	1.9657713584231804
We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner.	2.5819421317150817
It has become eminently political.	2.8853932459357585
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.	2.047831630501581
This is good, but it is not enough.	3.1787052399330573
Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal.	1.8616755975087829
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz.	1.8323685435717734
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria ' s integration process.	2.2273017283626544
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	2.1001990903189
Well in simple economic terms, Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity.	1.7812631085102908

Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	1.870650938185926
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.	2.3966631524886766
If they yield, they are lost.	2.307991673742452
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	2.2052670372158274
No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other.	1.8127472790085442
Do we have the results of this impact study?	2.768989930234459
Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental ' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury.	2.219668258380682
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments.	3.4818343231269027
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	2.4056472007072105
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission ' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission ' s period of office is not repeated.	3.1085761698089356
Given Poland ' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.	1.988807858051667
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	2.216546320511489
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	2.4182107698521365
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	2.658068561804494
Still relating to Thursday ' s sitting, the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda.	1.8365108038523068
As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive.	2.3299423020141004
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today ' s agenda has come full circle.	2.376609301100017
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year.	2.6701379345546097
Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out.	2.0010566366271956
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	3.655194934089
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.	1.8241029018668498
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition?	2.477512601249743
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.	2.154239565191728
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	1.978225843821188
This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations.	2.3537570670555774
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation.	2.0241051790810514
Report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999 - C5-0091/1999 and SN 5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809(CNS)	1.9153956111035007
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	2.5318674799108565
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	1.6385197687927955
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	1.9243076270989594
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	1.9371357350767047
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak ' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude, even physical absence, of the strong man of Damascus, President Assad, at the negotiations in the United States.	1.8930936236786435
Is that the message we want to send out?	2.860632133237071
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	2.156686832580588
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?	2.4331735407862984
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.	1.8515848027290598
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
That is a clear complaint that we get.	2.434157316260465
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too.	2.0733383654456476
Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances.	2.235960198683887
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	2.4102815184731448
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event.	2.131234317308968
I think that he is correct in this regard.	2.7865598541205765
However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti ' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital.	2.936167244707082
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	2.8775451715660942
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	2.344853507760041
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe.	2.402474355578866
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires.	2.126249417885751
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.	2.242940585909392
Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.	2.3448764634125867
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address.	2.15180785473867
Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition.	2.3682472413688775
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President, Fernando Cardoso, the Finnish Government, the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995.	1.9644916084547837
I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law.	2.5541911528970576
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way.	2.2309026159984966
After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour.	1.9498951243374414
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.	2.7225637738127264
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us.	2.203874002320292
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong.	1.775437321827125
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.	3.16194865726064
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	2.1905724693771913
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group.	2.547068715561445
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.	2.2789340069298247
It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties.	2.388848057867717
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects.	2.8986813739460455
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.	2.344368119069971
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision.	3.1498225668626882
Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue. If Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning, I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11(1) in particular.	2.0219893666225386
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	2.9508237608388472
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.	2.34307447338384
The number of departments has been reduced.	2.7811806883960837
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.	1.967259997683108
Commission 's strategic objectives and legislative programme	1.6431439686992144
I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation, but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles, created by what Alan Greenspan calls irrationally exuberant markets, burst.	2.209936143160788
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government.	1.9038681461704068
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	1.993915445041122
The Commission ' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market.	2.2587271745878303
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing.	2.2586649175067026
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.	2.048372622322717
They can also be consulted on the Commission 's Internet website.	3.2809564022992848
Briefly, these are the main points of the reform.	2.0550764115828
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question.	2.602761259107338
I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work.	2.0065093465814914
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council.	2.556109818433972
Nothing has changed there.	1.484345640719633
Not even Mr Sichrovsky ' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel ' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.	1.7403156939557947
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	3.100236233913421
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	2.8532288061419466
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.	2.7924367916755592
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	2.291753959972834
Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.	2.221306667522278
In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable.	2.004751676770645
Macedonia ' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries.	2.0611281872952096
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.	2.3342098403502067
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem, which is fair conditions, fair pay and fair hours.	2.419601489955155
However, I do want to listen to all the points of view.	2.5840725500273796
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	2.7156811135221073
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.	1.8247175307427257
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	1.5340613064337782
In other words, accession should not be held hostage to a political solution.	2.5765691159051687
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.	2.3078660715113064
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	2.1317264475337168
No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union.	1.7116562582445058
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.	2.367567641517688
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas.	2.1589390186050994
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe, which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, in February 2000.	2.8321552886042567
If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.	2.229786109870624
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	2.6117928942292004
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	2.6713343521588815
Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union ' s Member States?	2.3423691900467363
During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved.	2.105691029238668
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	2.6121367499473562
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	1.8173707669383536
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.	2.7757649949558605
(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.4508850366397787
By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years.	2.4339763174811293
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves.	2.170972106668839
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	2.733493322017573
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.	2.113207759314346
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.	2.0958573223866264
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.	2.4218986316960227
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	2.7041368389046925
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	2.416149825731828
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals.	1.8927121803424278
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.	1.991394306091549
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	2.414401515063274
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables.	2.6793513364252592
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.	2.3719458907387803
Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers ' health.	2.1117047630880985
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not.	2.365487824864178
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.	2.7782397161409054
Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union.	1.8775324768490838
It sets environmental parameters close to zero.	2.5307327938892255
An 's ' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta ' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta ' which is completely the contrary.	1.6227884655516978
It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image.	2.1938133248766514
Financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	1.856263017420188
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards" , it also applies between the institutions.	2.3196088721033927
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020.	2.239709093252625
At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid.	1.966011453132004
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.	4.017306383874497
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples ' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium.	2.140675006956701
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	2.3855471555312615
They are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government.	2.2743760855690787
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	2.163956564764154
To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union ' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted.	1.9760936831932425
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.	3.1388855581656308
Could you please give an answer on this issue?	1.5805548607343434
People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system.	2.2927039592718397
In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another.	2.5887175360297654
We are all aware that, to this end, it is essential for the Council to approve, as quickly as possible, the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing.	2.5054923673756093
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	1.925335406754391
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.	2.3979049915879247
Because they have to face social obstacles. Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest.	2.228193009335647
It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds.	1.9464718054061698
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment.	2.771479455525324
The next item is the joint debate on:	2.0310858842941584
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	1.8113747951501498
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet.	1.971483072588288
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	2.1531608883489626
On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	2.2677251379906775
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	2.3426847407316505
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation)	1.6236060446116354
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims, alimony claims and non-contested claims.	1.8693538590219547
Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.	2.052347067956288
Do not continue in this vein!	2.0454471926324147
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic: the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies.	2.2344107217301907
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?	2.1692693932676566
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	2.582469803529823
One can quote from the communication.	2.1062919631478834
You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech.	2.029096683628667
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.	1.688045735753722
The next item is the order of business.	2.291388160579928
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	2.698311234199754
(Parliament adopted the resolution)President.	1.853682773794938
The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe.	2.0113487206802243
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	1.9986314880589953
The second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day ' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island.	2.6619699800786605
It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice.	2.6888926922433236
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	2.5508846562194685
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3).	2.374897521582502
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.	2.01239883626485
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	2.2716994704897027
The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?	2.2800424598076434
Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems ' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments.	1.8323756545681213
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	1.793627914817911
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	2.393233099037344
The Commission ' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	2.3587468129221922
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda.	2.513798497911037
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies.	2.501799554736826
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	2.1123972651876683
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.	2.1593358773064737
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.	3.0706509730797737
At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.	1.9696418070621335
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.	3.0338824668659075
As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session.	2.276569139361816
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament ' s credibility.	2.9720693361772152
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled.	1.8549638140182891
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda ' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.	2.579919023608568
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	2.0794224866539093
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people ' s self-determination.	2.981296122239903
This leaves it wide open to abuse.	2.7287493207634226
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure.	1.9390216665421915
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.	1.9987719523659349
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
The population was not allowed any input.	2.96961318854721
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	2.4777112594350443
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	1.3745071786648317
I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself.	2.3035021323886733
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	2.262113299139963
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	1.7193348934511148
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal.	1.5515549456264084
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	3.399215987112443
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts.	1.9202179576788563
What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism?	1.844890125039557
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.	2.5176427099682446
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio ' s reports.	2.302872087117258
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard.	2.5893587230153168
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	2.427040033924145
The labour market is also changing.	3.166544704000771
It has to be redistributed time and again.	2.7017866136886584
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated.	3.0400966743773483
The moment of truth is approaching.	3.280210154363089
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.	2.4462901715634304
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers.	2.6498207861222642
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.	2.061273632221219
Mrs van der Laan ' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	2.6616846711659465
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	1.9744444185081897
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.	2.603862388675151
The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and, above all, the future of fishery products, an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years, now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs, unfortunately, of initial disenchantment.	2.103912296601148
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	2.1492744870583826
What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used.	2.5751800627255244
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question.	2.5790632023196367
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	2.1868293337255595
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	2.417293048503452
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process.	1.4389023240642473
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)	1.3179142615706378
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.	2.0160354583997107
This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed.	2.330662453725547
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission ' s original budget.	2.257928724578919
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods	1.6195101053048657
It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations.	1.9414558982240713
You have to admit: this is a joke.	2.774887767382958
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.	2.243003755383105
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.	2.2428461083449758
For example, Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there.	1.987019795456015
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.	2.33668478875477
Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing.	2.0239733973623593
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	2.5946820141956652
Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.	1.9032253706367586
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	2.712724251678093
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	2.0525118309557158
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.761614700315807
The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market.	2.3317461667306922
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political.	2.50246574308234
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy.	2.6361654415055233
Representatives of the Council, within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament.	2.3429175525108357
A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe ' s structural policies.	2.4311863858333247
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	1.8387588424785923
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.	2.7849025824124904
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow.	2.911204386736776
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	2.2273075877891175
It underlines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis, namely the unemployed, immigrants, refugees, women and the socially excluded.	2.5823201856709193
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them.	1.4597754827170175
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE.	2.045443821390762
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	1.9838208608504448
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	2.252451749940205
A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector.	2.4881373017247173
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees.	2.1861128897048228
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative.	2.135287753854792
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	2.616793165031915
Di Pietro report (A5-0019/2000)	1.4684141568266207
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year?	1.911710345908433
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	2.375179390505966
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	1.609926013820909
The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing.	2.407398359202766
Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail.	1.8325953270468198
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	2.388834530162003
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament 's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	2.728974056961139
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council.	2.805821901016249
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed.	2.3008594620792167
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission ' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers ' amendments to this point.	2.1831210713868594
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	2.409572087780429
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	2.605688153834408
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	2.385350571872139
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal.	2.483233429059075
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	1.9159250644397812
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions.	1.7836165641491168
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	1.9680992214364768
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders.	2.8077450894460116
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	2.1835074628318245
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	2.313138851144871
Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy.	1.5821962916311998
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	2.9417201480079456
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.	2.23323657464733
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	2.745034400754105
This is a big task but it can be done.	2.6274985616701425
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible.	2.9769946676572006
The nature of the EU has not changed.	5.3386932302101995
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead.	2.2308555396543785
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won 't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted.	2.051763288552519
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	2.904775962095826
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	2.3416504443160004
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	2.5950025463008903
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.	2.1572558261034267
But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government.	2.0545322906665815
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions.	2.113089004847702
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy.	2.434935889685266
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.	2.4350210670514643
I do not like the term 'leftovers ' any more than Richard Corbett does.	2.2446165451102886
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	2.0494107492317424
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year.	2.456609904259917
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	2.3199179797434484
For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.	2.1178921321264967
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet.	2.64339872131496
Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service.	2.650637127284403
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky ' s whereabouts and his state of health.	2.194492435694425
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	2.24951443788422
The United Nation ' s, and Mr Kouchner ' s, mission in Kosovo ended in failure.	2.19992847809174
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject.	2.1857089771156586
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming, mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs.	2.4542362339142048
The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support.	2.068312452717797
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	2.3325516071748416
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.	2.206533546167936
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982.	2.1645705428197712
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	3.1479352909527774
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	2.5247916330841393
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.	3.4629557698130164
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	2.352737639497809
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.	2.6261198382825133
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council.	2.3134526630224355
In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.	2.033406913982261
We think they should.	3.5512171068864236
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	2.372567135914391
I worked in Africa 30 years ago, and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic.	2.3029071931855003
The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails.	2.4997844554237796
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	2.2884975427797056
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products.	2.0090506557677115
This motion asks the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax. It also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens.	2.0592183498869625
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	1.9749972777765352
They will look into the matter thoroughly.	2.600066346087767
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States.	3.1427732863313773
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	2.8217072944131654
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	2.5289130564349853
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources.	1.838886922849441
Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen ' so often.	1.836709733925375
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.	1.939958925280198
Mr President, the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals, notably, of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group, which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and, in my opinion, this version is an improvement on the original.	2.565628593710154
We have endeavoured to provide material help.	2.818882811309076
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	2.4941253138953683
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.	2.6484820591221556
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament ' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	2.646236036478855
It damages Parliament.	3.887036201471293
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?	1.572536696920596
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.	1.5096035601413242
We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure.	3.206884999574554
This is largely due to historical factors.	2.5370220114962456
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.	2.289176448821764
Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin ' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything?	1.8091274885767759
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.	2.6366154073930703
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member.	2.337333671993789
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission ' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	2.2543988272705286
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	2.198477677854374
With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries ' special economic and social limitations.	2.6550126623129975
Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients;	1.9386957992863036
As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	2.441738629934176
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies ' turnover.	1.5491078830395917
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.	2.3250258562073385
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors ' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.	2.198492679126694
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC.	2.458288979386418
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	2.3456571104697455
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth.	2.5094890369954412
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	2.775761285406422
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.	4.178120968031924
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	1.8771983420857268
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996.	1.433740820470007
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.	2.5631325812538077
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):	1.797228348273236
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month.	2.246896474381661
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.	2.710784232645514
The investment needs to be visionary.	4.5833447180517375
Water, in this context, is a commercial commodity.	1.6511215342020638
In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice.	2.183371462019034
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	1.8292455053733723
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.	2.816517182421753
This is not policy; it is life ' s simple logic.	2.233320614860195
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	2.554293103394016
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	2.2029076484793344
The Court 's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	3.064800086252538
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last.	2.615605156397245
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed.	1.8697755506244602
In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few.	2.199416716128272
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament ' s more drastic positioning.	2.8697558028948733
More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs.	2.284074182038123
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	1.9736837659087731
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	2.3078621571013365
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards.	2.0227161511513954
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	2.53439791738364
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.	3.0117937070692014
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent.	2.208718029264825
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	1.6295094908407544
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	2.752057089694892
In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States.	1.8944049269656502
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	1.7708050189216027
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.	2.0686914465494226
The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas.	3.4163887087521037
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	1.8219813214273264
It is a highly complex problem.	2.933400410238105
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	2.324826485849521
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this.	2.4463066639377256
Let us make ourselves heard!	2.0786292215890456
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio ' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	2.085925541153866
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	2.323686558829167
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	2.665055439247637
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	2.248014238602223
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.	3.141616317585991
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.	2.373895523301637
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder ' s view.	1.856370825221117
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter.	2.229506138819726
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	3.244325693943428
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.	2.818977669564264
Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.	2.732832825531573
However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission 's insistence.	2.1680390299496737
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.	2.055037002699413
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	1.8528670401358656
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	2.494912002064328
Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.	2.086095856427135
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court.	2.783490540338174
With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels.	2.118100347397436
I completely understand your concerns, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue.	2.7961497512039917
In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.	1.6818689758609648
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.	2.585346076700359
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.	1.9625756655804054
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.	2.358467453657202
Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic.	1.9308021494863785
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	2.50719369398784
Postal services must continue to be public services.	1.8471744762679225
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch ' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.	2.111278895727733
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.	2.40588811067212
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	2.3592472699391243
I can testify to this remarkable work.	2.750772643977241
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	1.9527739941543207
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention.	2.6506222371349
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	2.470082436487641
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	3.0552234477317306
The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water.	2.0518775862162792
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	2.8383372441788013
(The Minutes were adopted)	1.8709874504406507
I hope that Parliament 's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place.	2.571259439708683
Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself.	2.1864373578654313
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	2.457019699580623
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.	2.672135905572143
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it.	2.9458615256722984
However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used.	2.3749176818612914
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights?	2.0713677704062743
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.	2.499367153287743
Turkey 's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey 's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	1.367848603082245
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state, government and party delirium as regards the European Union ' s funding.	2.5977686958332367
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	2.6163662182507283
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.	2.6354123592341643
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	2.0433125647256714
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy ' .	2.0666581606661945
However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market.	2.3994659277066495
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi.	2.5064973028851547
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds.	3.541846894301072
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission ' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	3.2085094249836965
Thank you for listening.	2.158155353987964
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	2.0972761227532457
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health.	2.817006958022456
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	2.7464699988286903
We have arrived at the final question.	3.0760714955054733
We do not accept this agreement, which deprives people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the European multinationals and banks.	2.5262060576091336
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.	2.3469934944788946
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement	2.3222506260058156
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	2.8238215960072375
I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens ' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union.	2.2519521097827573
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	2.201117593445379
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.	2.4531020460863058
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique.	2.0491945779596423
Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.	2.324417317411298
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis.	2.4240310018782942
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	2.3049292535552657
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?	2.2570589699441297
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.	2.381738329769658
With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality, as you know, this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.380090240888153
The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	2.2073816087233533
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	2.064797759553794
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.	2.247108626577542
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.	3.3712956072764473
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment.	2.729027620750524
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility.	2.5565967832522922
In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded.	2.9927106982858054
Action is not limited to legislation.	1.6218520070755194
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission 's work programme for 2000.	3.167047366129814
Has any thought been given to the matter?	1.9104050621182853
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member ' s first question and the supplementary question.	2.64614891905045
Paragraph D points out that "the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils.	2.1597539267730883
In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language.	2.9001033905134346
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.	2.878089289429115
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	2.267007998855662
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	2.2209816030672984
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	2.3753792851628757
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?	3.0403601751391114
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union ' s per capita GDP level.	2.96983607444365
In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places.	2.3339152778799543
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten 's report.	2.347760973426969
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.	2.0783453171035022
On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves.	2.124514930253902
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3.	2.0632014666585703
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard.	1.5611159701240245
Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries.	1.8697033768823588
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?	2.3872456403097946
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	2.2633452102851073
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	2.6077119405719604
Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here.	3.2201466203698024
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	2.589929204956376
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.	2.162460644306473
This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for.	2.0901694800674773
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.	2.6342368267627814
It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court.	2.8094621659882666
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise.	1.640749284808129
Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact.	2.5121469730821846
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality.	2.4923348426371597
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000 ' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.	2.090293820777877
I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing.	3.0291390785508896
I am especially grateful for all of this.	2.821783886085369
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	2.837899729165871
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.	1.9564817907758458
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	1.7385420317169755
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.	3.5403209933683355
I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women ' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field.	2.1438171044293153
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.	2.9763196565487675
This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs.	2.810887668529468
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	2.515477620978407
Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler ' s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative.	1.7408194724172223
In my view, and I say this quite clearly, the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused.	2.263371201602954
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	1.8914067273992747
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.	2.061800169861458
Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation.	2.572452651316291
We share them.	3.9851771145886685
The European Council in Helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which, as I said at the beginning of my first speech, represent a window of opportunity.	2.328048045781819
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	1.861900111967282
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.	2.13638407095023
That message must be taken back from here today.	2.6974695625958622
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending.	2.8621497689714643
We all agree on this.	2.856542324785996
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.	2.105969906262298
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret.	2.653426300899234
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off.	2.098705311197573
This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment.	1.9468458971411404
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy.	2.4983642809211464
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.	2.2375836913786413
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	2.3794389456593628
To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it.	2.175396546675068
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	2.479378928272524
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	2.459879434890022
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	2.4786851524346356
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.	2.364656003304518
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	2.6456190219936877
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	1.593013828235602
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	2.1946246332019808
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	1.8677098294413257
Secondly, the new "in" word is flexibility.	1.9206206508918156
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers ' liability.	2.2264110279441223
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.	2.1538574857238983
Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels.	1.5068497585160152
How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know.	1.948391286724623
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	2.114692682735813
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.	2.44588005672044
Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other ' s competence.	2.2329702405805674
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive.	2.9363199122726105
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question.	1.6647678859743644
Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.	2.558076517003149
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision.	2.648031073306199
- (FR) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria.	2.697492690065239
With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.	2.0586024472788096
The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater.	2.131728617138566
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	2.4584997978659757
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	2.0946246797199826
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.	2.6063720942448194
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	2.1961642927465936
They see us killing each other.	2.0575769052816275
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February.	2.3549487786087293
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	2.4988977335676625
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.	2.395228821207555
I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.	2.0623060758281873
We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it.	2.303898827123295
Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross.	1.532448023357466
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	2.1554642538278417
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider 's adherents.	2.076194652938623
When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises.	2.357047876980053
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively.	2.8384230027469863
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	2.167208387742373
Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	2.559249137627058
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time.	2.4116207653529607
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.	2.702700794016589
Thank you very much.	1.796622429959308
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime.	2.315257627715155
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	2.1485694061474447
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece ' s initiative.	2.0151967033415237
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe ' s consumers.	2.1765002973265326
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.	1.9311219931772385
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.	3.227218747957609
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	2.1893253909898718
It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits.	2.030723405787974
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	1.8982115222058595
Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like.	2.526873202773695
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech, 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, and a fundamental expectation, as from this year, that will be realised in the form of specific actions.	2.0889868541318637
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	2.2314606837146087
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.	3.3937937411325634
I think that this will be problematic.	3.335026453156505
I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays ' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions.	2.170985200773093
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.	1.9275895849105806
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.	3.067448652057675
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.	2.410073280326544
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site.	1.9015074060674324
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising.	1.9294779662253776
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served	2.6240166695393654
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set.	2.0488991952531097
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	1.7994926112217808
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	2.726127704410951
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	2.7955758147685374
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee.	2.640731073941703
Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	2.0569150632351496
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	2.3868383045421675
Since then, expectations have been high.	1.9232585020598667
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	1.7007229101768297
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!	2.4333940451002594
It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well.	2.1310436009980656
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002, everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro.	2.0598018865503644
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions.	2.1728821584141524
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	2.120389144770828
.	1.374839594702952
Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed.	2.4232242883427872
The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes.	2.900266936573159
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.	2.0921010589994005
It is also of great importance to citizens.	2.9636035923574067
It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing.	2.2292500022375545
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.	2.2594195660423977
Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union.	2.0381695417356385
Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed.	1.998030475524243
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	2.689666391538267
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences.	3.832145142905469
For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country.	2.148652554100652
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.	2.037326047783588
In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative.	2.42209817787079
People are especially wary of GMOs.	1.598037577925567
It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!	2.163354910874967
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign?	2.0546381614918157
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	2.33859063278246
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)	2.0021071051201864
Would this be in the interests of Europe 's citizens?	2.377691556673101
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on.	3.0087045697318278
I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal.	3.062595023539378
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	1.4399742861446017
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	2.4541866498098264
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	3.0958312793928626
If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again.	2.149813911972546
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.	2.2426942667726277
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	3.63429210948834
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	2.1637177407107178
You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere.	2.8226371867196436
We are all immigrants.	3.2617778838738674
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	2.366613911287309
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia, for that matter.	2.3224140807438083
As regards taxation, state aid, the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products, practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.	1.9083197726694918
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	1.6829305612717242
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe" ?	2.0540883565548733
We all, throughout the European institutions - in Parliament, the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years.	2.6787357247158834
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	2.144841607444109
The fact that, due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data, the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale.	2.096393880589503
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	1.7090559888086068
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission ' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	2.7848721933505383
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.	2.751048138348413
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.	2.2997993319753958
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	2.239860706639197
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	2.6995676555899806
Now I believe, Commissioner, this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament ' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken, otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past.	2.3854975867624253
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	2.659263875542698
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission ' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.	2.3277313578155
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	2.3095484356050093
But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year.	1.7670666195829177
However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy.	3.016123113738616
Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.	1.6886938215755756
The matter is still open.	3.5110653691689984
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.	2.1841108907378004
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case.	3.273219912941213
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur.	2.8553937458566794
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament ' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	2.251739268376373
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes.	2.6144063290719735
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	1.8165152506441096
On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	2.0514316398455286
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	2.9544641295657414
Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity.	1.8353905744621342
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	3.0211028403188798
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer ' s freedom of choice.	1.9949210303302125
In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation.	1.9786948260046542
This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame.	2.8819095699689448
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause.	2.225311541219608
The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority.	2.4659320410195047
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	2.013810329966189
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.	2.594651888589923
We have serious reservations about the Council ' s proposed amendments.	3.1939059210769556
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	2.5930921177363135
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.8652139024193484
Will the Commission remain silent?	1.8794484987675661
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.	1.7537683423290409
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.	2.593575356165936
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	2.7184232970923783
In view of the humanitarian aid being given by the European Union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration, Mr Bernard Kouchner, what measures will the Council take to defend the rights of the women of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women, women in confinement and new-born children?	2.352882673301665
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	2.4756587237199006
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.	2.4673509993209755
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.	1.7829031817365055
On the common agricultural policy, the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms.	2.0682104865913877
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing ' .	1.8499396658950593
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	2.6340374570478886
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes.	2.704140251859006
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be.	1.7771188165129292
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	3.589620074916031
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	2.8645314769366914
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions.	2.4698944790327215
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	2.746185554688238
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	2.4267576448506936
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	2.7017876587092604
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	2.2698266188015794
I am using the phrase 'is said to be ' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.	1.9961288257073424
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.	2.3017585842782027
The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99.	2.1590261786219616
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.	1.9613268126496135
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.	2.7203751390586173
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.	4.718678756390307
However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.	2.781253371084969
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	2.9435246351244726
Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes.	1.9438399348689646
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.	2.368422601213717
We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament ' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.1230403626599412
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	1.9120168516699825
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	2.714107116969796
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	2.3493081275377623
The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.	2.177785747272108
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming ' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission ' s programme.	2.50866659690372
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	3.0776140647154633
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	2.524574505688053
They were treated like the worst criminals.	2.247556179976498
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece ' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM ' s progress towards a United Europe.	2.0456968769199326
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.	2.498719215879933
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	2.209041550081365
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities?	2.466372471981089
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	2.1813773564764847
We await the outcome with great interest.	2.629180052780786
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.	2.136001643299935
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.	2.7672699543233947
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.	2.4561985748877264
Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights.	2.1949347642573773
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.	3.234571017130265
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument.	2.5274132659896025
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.	2.348399063825902
Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields.	2.5247967494816757
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	3.1393973862079085
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	2.816871905140656
Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism.	1.5387243381737652
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	3.2098769601794968
We have to act now, before it is too late.	2.535472677154998
We should salute it - and I think we do.	3.8719846411471712
That is important.	2.367875901986552
Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge.	2.1476433598168794
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.	2.5447628743559068
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	2.7865434753337417
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	2.362154603773231
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	2.6510433924808487
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.	2.5070450471621157
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation.	1.6477664574168538
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	1.7933334163180585
More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs.	2.2999903104011965
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them.	2.19196778697257
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better.	2.3683436058583243
However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?	2.1691672129439366
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service ' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.	1.9958292833180404
I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said.	2.9403955787281943
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life ' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.	2.371198121879887
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission 's main vocation.	2.2531851930945055
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	2.113559915061154
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	2.490570074747866
Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.	1.6058407533813515
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now, part of its very essence, its heart and soul.	2.5021658455877946
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	2.1567463406654737
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	2.7745787681358456
I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament.	2.1672691283114447
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	2.3254305097825023
Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union.	2.158299494259624
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements.	2.5649432148739746
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community.	2.3663642819632984
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025.	2.13499271503346
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.	2.9202418657829763
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December.	2.646376566780502
The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled.	2.38346619093677
I beg you to intervene.	3.3706001917574797
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.	3.2353894756119668
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent.	1.5345466592926789
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	2.7597134766568105
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.	2.629864427143098
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.	2.345481515886032
Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it.	1.9757103584875209
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	2.6624252615373023
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner ' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.	1.982426444640711
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	2.0520641266850626
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	2.3894003570918696
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials ' with 'government officials ' .	1.4697733902756007
(FR) Mr President, we have already had the opportunity, at the first reading, to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House.	2.3320788676913335
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society.	2.758579092855981
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?	1.7675945062551695
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	2.4953762288352257
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly.	2.2404710746109253
In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.	2.192466773971749
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers ' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.	2.647016778131366
We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action.	2.0573285137987947
In order to generate extra means if necessary, I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors.	2.5362322837887676
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.	2.3305471387304015
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	2.3173035554498815
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	2.5639978243924433
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
We need to look very carefully at those.	2.6121276057628746
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union ' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.	2.405257580817422
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.	2.280104314254385
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	1.9413116499671699
If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.	2.074467396495653
Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position.	1.967782572237964
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	2.2707540119845206
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.4716188326280957
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	2.7654717824507444
We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees.	2.107960846908223
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.	2.1526048547229175
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	1.918193587539668
In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements.	2.990759076235048
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.	1.9799202434229943
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament ' s original position on the issue of comitology.	2.768814240868862
To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights.	2.0649755565344976
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.	2.633955245289322
And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to "refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention" .	1.8195419484985018
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.	2.549404831502686
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.	2.214809151634338
One example is the use of peat.	2.754591995262822
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):	1.7453051511156166
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	3.4218294493150836
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	2.072660523075831
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring.	2.5892869495381796
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	2.9688298382286678
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets.	1.7677602163331803
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	3.150395176978792
My vote was "in favour" .	2.14078934810607
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.	2.575021997978016
As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value.	1.993090727944964
I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience.	2.2155187894378616
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?	2.323844438095769
(IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay ' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission ' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.	2.479602914854692
I emphasise the word 'could ' , and that is if it is done well and with care.	3.017048467372786
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	2.184883278189034
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions.	2.726481446048746
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation.	2.1699101686062034
Mr President, today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.	2.6386211091967247
Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted.	2.249746389763065
It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.	2.3036848614114636
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.	2.6309230732103233
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.	2.219837229313339
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	2.180255373210075
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union ' s financial programmes and instruments.	3.057041042066124
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	2.9684661672167403
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	2.204385111536065
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.	2.1841700778100877
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.	2.570106500453011
Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be .	2.1868090443090407
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	2.1792714143568492
In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity.	2.7420300390784758
Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation.	1.9151166622420526
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation.	2.3090128580039524
Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets?	2.184896096969946
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	2.938250748855408
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.	2.1542868462969595
Employers would be lost without immigrants.	1.3777554160218795
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.	2.7584456901041263
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.	2.1422189224409025
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	1.6135215729867085
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.	2.0933178727699913
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	2.4183151710809474
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	2.0984617827197853
Welcome	1.0963477464416975
Under the European Community ' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	1.7850966927630276
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.	1.753943713760759
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	1.582408929381203
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.	2.3425153430772285
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.	3.112424956957882
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.	1.9506128886693683
It should seal their revival.	2.915409248753412
So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.	2.201445137377852
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.	2.056137822446302
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.	2.0515962799740066
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.	1.8797107394876014
This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species, such as tuna in this case.	2.0933828901173346
The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual.	2.2555969154520707
I want to underline that point.	3.089172753280891
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	2.5794132838828294
Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent.	2.216677008132947
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one ' s own interests.	2.171707313322665
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?	2.28161353655922
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	2.71644158121029
According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament 's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years.	2.220806618259465
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo ' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	1.932731468160201
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities.	2.0718990996936055
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	1.8205716059379964
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	2.041069310943521
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	1.980775586471729
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm.	2.324836850085744
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.	2.6093449531227937
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.	2.5797145190707043
The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC).	2.5696615178173823
Firstly, to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies, subsequently, following invitation to tender, to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations.	1.6737477266007736
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	2.1685384099737988
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	1.387578654911984
He stated: "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance."	1.975568662839698
If this 'feedback ' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	2.3851943834855804
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.	2.3475243637509546
The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced.	2.994162680168764
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.	2.486950752129161
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies.	2.3134664433666705
We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.	2.6192874891036424
In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable.	2.491683501760391
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	2.6908507928670216
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.	2.3645055721079613
The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed.	2.756521805343608
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.	2.139939092181888
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	2.3648850180114938
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion.	2.6099947303444955
Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.	2.0046915750354914
Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.	2.341941879937519
So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not.	1.8288955089925159
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave.	2.2094063300477993
Madam President, I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that, during the conciliation procedure, I was personally a little disappointed with the Council.	2.339745031834704
They have very little of it.	2.1619239933834713
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel.	1.7024380495891709
This question has now entered a different dimension, a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments, no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy.	1.9059336693081463
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force.	2.156563566443471
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union ' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	2.3593865429774317
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.	2.899332281483811
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together.	2.3109622420535634
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.	2.799067110148583
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen, which concerns aid to the steel industry.	2.9097039295484843
For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.	2.1995753750201352
Is that really authorised?	2.274184634256402
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue.	2.5624977952046972
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	2.0482125311264565
However, forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me.	2.440772256825895
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.	1.88986900540388
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme ' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	2.7255798928457295
Direct business to consumer contact will supplement, and sometimes also reduce, the currently, nearly exclusive business to business relationship.	1.3496143103385794
In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character.	2.7177121754961426
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.	1.6937372537346418
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	2.100248772184791
	1.0510108151299706
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.	2.050432604387152
Parliament has completed the agenda.	1.866346780480541
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange.	3.14312677858873
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach.	2.417824798677065
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	2.6403895956421843
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test?	2.000508160754259
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	2.1901030446888963
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned.	2.5648480369888897
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis ' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect.	1.9352027052496572
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.	2.27332978655995
Before the final vote:	1.7716523493423704
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	2.1750456736399753
We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda.	1.9709389780410131
The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise.	1.9929438770030545
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	2.4157841381434793
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.	2.1713137274444207
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	3.3455391132605343
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.	2.2011982943879893
We have also asked Parliament ' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries.	2.929891916706551
It is not a quota!	3.6231693256051316
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	2.29422088058624
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	1.9221508928112816
Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before.	2.7579300967635056
My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe '.	2.1679666354052256
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect.	2.2767618536710095
Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission.	2.0359431164116257
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	2.085517186334232
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	2.299943834699893
Commissioner, we must be consistent.	3.0308581988144
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	1.8076183379343722
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme.	2.469495886750476
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation.	2.441261220434795
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.	2.3436719151974095
That is indeed distortion of the internal market.	2.1100748093604835
I am a European and even a federalist.	3.4604390780177265
I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce.	2.264225428377202
I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front.	1.8882668283865387
When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.	2.1051357476051153
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.	3.256459412056631
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	2.5586591689460634
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	2.2132621822751015
Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.	2.7979023804173346
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	2.710853104777023
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.	2.352057709578938
Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.	1.9855892571764513
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	2.016005312736031
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean.	2.207495698591682
As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago.	2.096476537189647
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	2.3846130859457255
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	2.16284664145073
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	2.1953176501833953
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.	2.36616994762644
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	2.919759850931164
In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.	2.323690487894611
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?	2.2507998060664263
It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock.	2.1147002685014633
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.	1.8859148652034123
Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life.	1.9160159901379337
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	2.5467033150582976
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.	1.647500397982843
One is subsidiarity.	2.4304343521484935
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	2.458335432554416
I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group.	3.004713710567477
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives.	2.264539167449139
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	2.26127781593626
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe ' s citizens.	2.9032514954336013
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.	2.8273900639245526
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains.	2.29623762358345
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way.	3.006493191429077
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful.	2.7856123215305626
Secondly, as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in?	2.864259819740972
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):	1.8126066334894742
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.	2.0558911277703875
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.	2.9144208311912765
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed.	1.9794262871168284
They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors.	2.616356576870627
Maritime transport, industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing.	1.5769028704418666
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	2.697537272041786
For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa.	1.9545198114604394
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.	3.4414149458277574
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation	3.7154706280689047
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible.	2.365854103905462
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	3.0230260210918116
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union ' s institutions.	2.367134841038516
This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April.	2.7159629880909626
In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs.	2.2530095825423384
The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission ' s opinions on the amendments under discussion.	2.5239405047609487
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	1.8188659835499967
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	2.4597675519229685
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place.	2.1973280211532162
We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments.	2.058899238000478
It is also worth noting that International Women ' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.	2.0227456701837014
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.	2.3608712585950147
The real world simply does not work like that.	2.63501098302723
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.	1.9785274509931485
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO ' s action and the legitimacy of that action.	2.4984295283950493
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	2.540434959286316
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.	2.494874985855771
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	2.3983449728236756
This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment.	2.4908506926034404
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep.	2.736626914317753
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples?	2.051063420100764
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	2.5432755345890956
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable.	2.4099507654234347
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?	2.211513006459541
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	2.050231506769888
Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.	2.1297424543588175
On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down.	2.1414939070737105
These are the three most important aims of the directive.	2.1397387468082485
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	2.1863400196547973
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.	2.352789349781128
To set my fellow Members ' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women ' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	2.2031433921150985
The victims are waiting outside.	3.479660600390651
It is Commissioner Bolkestein ' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year.	2.71504073754145
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	2.371038698947123
What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at Sète or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it.	1.6799853834046674
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	2.0680589860618466
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.	2.206675191048015
It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister.	1.934321870978429
. I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers.	2.7236371337135497
Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds.	2.6615856796477706
Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group ' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success.	2.764127185670144
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	1.7164686652117866
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	2.814562933673349
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.	3.0862984459576275
Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999.	1.6450341098233099
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.	1.6698818688071133
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	3.8392300610880064
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union.	2.693320145108735
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	1.8561431552090764
On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens.	2.1897800075871308
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	2.1952676444414276
And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to.	2.3741849753963598
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	2.7498993909276637
The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation.	2.110461404517112
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	2.250577676704444
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.	1.825345397348525
Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive ' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive ' , hinders implementation.	1.7035296299138225
Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	3.0251219218741214
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine 's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	1.937762189060839
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.	2.5918990614587782
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	2.2235345798687605
We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU.	1.9654101650437492
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	3.4336027584379476
After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation.	1.9149265528761736
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.	2.0581522997263395
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post ' s numerous recent acquisitions.	2.2838764505551614
The challenges are different.	3.469235851823502
The introduction of these new technologies is not a threat, but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services, which our tourism needs for an ever-lengthening tourism season, so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism.	1.9897152984316855
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	2.78630034026912
I will set this out in five points.	2.795189225415042
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate?	1.844367064077853
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	2.4718579666653
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread.	2.1864834134410684
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	2.3221321961471446
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.	1.7478473263169172
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.	1.8926558815446426
What is important, however, is that they have begun.	3.0826858671565724
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.	2.6535352933029377
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	1.8622865113161002
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	1.9490886215038072
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right.	1.7752980155634503
This is no longer tolerable.	2.78400651595158
There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner ' s efforts to return Kosovo ' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive.	2.4268175854109986
I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning ' s discussion.	3.601909152156198
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	2.5419373886554735
It should not be in the amendment.	3.9263268834339184
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.	2.3022614385744564
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	2.7088885559005025
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can ' .	2.4802312386114234
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe.	2.0931052268394668
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.	2.7886294088329233
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain.	2.1148984161098943
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	2.089847603105886
Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.	2.0483828679084555
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	2.129407612564335
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part.	2.152862551545579
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.	2.8631109579072387
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	2.4417988156677173
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively.	2.1953757490763235
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.	2.2589158076974196
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.	1.9950062040626448
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	2.126761618875019
The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down.	2.6592190528737736
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.	3.151325103024732
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues.	2.478613035322766
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	2.66836022893444
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons.	2.714675473592529
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.	3.015281474638894
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital.	2.777958792897764
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	2.702068311060285
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama ' s insights, as he arrived hot-foot from the region.	2.3525156507016236
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	2.6620914464165693
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	2.1474969966538087
Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire.	1.5955898379218398
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	1.8715566952584144
Firstly the agreement on political issues.	1.7325534298661063
Over the next seven years, the Commission ' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	2.352405995881497
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):	1.823920024070336
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	2.174304617955509
And this is not pure chance.	2.8769634883781956
And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later.	1.9556953273416842
The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough.	2.447101061686886
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.	2.4369530080568844
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	1.829538287524196
If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste.	1.8015575047221408
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions.	2.6784189927153865
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation.	2.357489062964977
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.	2.5154487404159154
The form the aid takes is important.	2.860022048670431
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes!	2.2429581322520984
But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"!	2.2053677374620024
Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years.	1.6811927968122675
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	2.7140112566573933
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women.	2.280447920599908
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	2.0512217309164322
Has it been discussed?	1.5180376723154363
It seems contradictory.	3.7917520593290273
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control ' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.	3.3472719129094344
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	2.0296860123643463
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians.	2.6066497508539213
It is indeed.	3.508935308599903
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission ' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	2.0158904213198143
On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more.	2.051754674448817
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term.	2.1545116561706776
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.	2.1197649015888036
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world ' s most dynamic and competitive regions.	2.2137556638283007
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	1.991738073298629
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today ' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	2.7341818700476317
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves.	2.867153536732915
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	2.0237313423429746
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	2.2485464797417114
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	1.9712585224780024
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.	2.280537862228541
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	1.929356892623523
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	2.312824435924729
Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.	2.1819410530450813
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress.	2.359643336769721
Moreover, it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded.	2.9981892098881358
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it?	1.8793854141481743
We have put down an amendment to that effect.	2.8491183273699314
Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG!	1.8833808638924854
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.	2.751069907563964
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel ' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	1.8588568568895076
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House.	2.2142032742978537
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable?	2.0568483293838202
This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.	2.5782076785090875
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.	2.2794594638264196
(FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation.	1.7851579278976382
Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)	1.741872442090498
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	2.819216355663171
(Parliament approved the joint text)	1.5047002582325815
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.	2.6117974083451774
In order to function, the market needs rules.	2.258318492725373
Mr President, the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union.	2.717428464143482
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	2.783417887758114
If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this.	2.604416394055378
Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation.	2.225007960770493
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.	2.7126633448530586
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions when, from what the speakers have said in this Parliament, from all sides of the House, there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta.	2.4235844057653253
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside.	1.9378451162418802
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.	3.5947417936990043
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding ' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	1.8747746021738594
Today ' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.	1.8968925820941205
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things.	1.8631803271001353
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	2.807386712484135
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	1.714432404772427
Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever.	1.6255629804931375
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other.	2.3619370778416804
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union ' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.	2.5398398531515705
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.	2.2808898495114027
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues.	2.409296628871507
Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.	1.9125167917490131
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings.	2.373294983693731
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	2.323489910651949
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.	2.314852680927208
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims ' families.	3.530947969773108
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems.	2.9857827383346
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind.	2.98498445953944
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.	1.9671348772848574
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade.	2.8654901895048406
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	2.5553760201188345
In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries.	1.9357834923856223
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	2.747281627514785
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)	1.5540944303769562
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.	1.8439935284866908
Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity.	2.0547229147299397
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	2.73569037450832
There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks.	2.7135862929314993
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it.	2.5640768299040855
But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself?	3.197596218509564
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.	2.3636158557778546
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive.	2.4940806107120896
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country.	1.856142553951818
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	2.1479913622645355
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters.	1.5308859059309643
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.	2.261553079422149
They need a political deal.	2.356036252613411
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	3.6093671388700805
We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one.	2.57749000045182
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.	2.6905676480121863
The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today.	3.134889087798804
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention, which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today: a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect.	2.3345359657550735
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe.	2.203463055017106
This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world ' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively.	2.581395282049676
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	2.15703146801492
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	2.2633350650487625
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there.	3.1218490625444075
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.3859000881963475
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards.	2.051752556977489
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	2.380367880404176
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	2.335781474892051
Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.	2.067663141811742
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.	2.10944221100077
As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments.	2.342119201804398
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	2.1162850487497034
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	1.6762632041965115
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation.	2.531157592553986
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	1.9853779658516146
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	2.8725448304977808
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission.	2.6122101983381487
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244.	2.3471958916344797
As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers.	2.213428015703155
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?	4.3612594015111625
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	1.6852629620548074
Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old.	1.510860091470059
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans.	2.9716692849914184
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	2.189261996108759
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	2.3335829085146096
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible.	4.3517705110188825
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate.	2.123569227324879
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	3.174163980599094
You see, the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport, its reduced cost, and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe.	1.7853549556914592
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face.	2.382357860562081
I believe that Mrs Theato ' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	2.6708988814265617
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	2.034029303102228
Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.	2.0443264584908096
The Arab world ' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria ' s fight for freedom against France.	2.0921014349557128
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.	1.975924975191094
We have all spoken favourably of this programme ' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	2.560634611823238
We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity.	2.436571850940072
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	2.4776279266547987
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.	1.9243268674702312
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	1.9675334080445461
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	2.3227411650951577
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows?	1.8296677186528592
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	2.2623411976890977
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	2.191210882981603
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?	2.4006094479614575
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.	1.8073947847125647
We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone.	1.9520378371263771
That concludes the vote.	2.364597567938854
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	2.5182586709612087
As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet.	2.559106155296404
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French.	1.7977175946494017
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	2.279111878123631
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.	2.495069588750636
The other question is who should bear the cost.	2.5886747893841235
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective.	2.1830741948103625
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.	1.4978033362697518
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.	1.7983221026418585
Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon.	2.0081178484974025
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity.	3.1396073868180903
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe ' s economy.	2.5290109189121885
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.	2.961302817088889
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million.	1.9057243792225964
To continue would be economic suicide.	2.125212956260359
While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches.	2.1374521732410057
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.	1.7610516403850038
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.	2.204048805695193
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	2.8321383445844317
Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on?	1.8637551412736826
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.	2.331109996959191
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	2.3492014707183553
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.	2.301541184864061
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.	2.2035978181490394
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.	2.258883003893315
Are there any comments?	1.2644728256185398
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see.	2.7894116998598726
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General.	3.3280289193881996
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	2.201935922942095
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax, such as the Tobin tax, as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation, so to speak.	2.3178560434366804
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	2.788428322529577
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer.	3.025517409779305
It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products.	2.046772758840818
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey 's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	2.122291537896842
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.	1.8958525328446605
As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities.	2.0467780175190864
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.	2.5899931041820503
Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing.	2.071032238632122
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	2.4656660952988423
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them.	3.499444124663771
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	2.587599465588434
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.8652139024193484
To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan.	1.854671385608506
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	2.6119828187192184
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects.	2.5577085842002445
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.	2.0790712550047936
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	1.9093791677079472
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	2.276753019474791
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	2.474210246696432
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.	2.017767054096494
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this?	2.0625737338159316
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future.	1.9992356898655277
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	2.5351407543770885
Some Members have even come out against this.	1.9480058379610015
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way, and this is unacceptable.	2.6593970397360045
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.	3.1301709693260484
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	2.6514150103031837
As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal.	2.5201920032480825
Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission ' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	2.6737989213390883
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.	2.8889343918192574
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.	1.8836625930455746
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	2.095796769876659
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2183945468114763
The Union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.	3.3213725264443257
This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 7.	2.886881644152351
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi, has quite won me over.	1.7998341273075753
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	2.3645553028973705
The Commission ' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.	2.3271859518621065
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period.	2.0975553418236763
But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency.	2.5312310774252165
Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.	2.1272498479224295
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.	1.8037312252437971
So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor ' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented?	1.9672479499398454
Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind.	1.9202802179951632
We welcome the report ' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States.	2.4061443257468844
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	2.3606289664953124
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.	2.486067328214627
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people.	2.1935709487892683
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors.	2.509227429827495
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections?	2.315847033570094
It will also continue to fight for Member States ' acceptance of this.	2.9683870047552157
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.	2.0565804324893517
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.	2.1980900468008935
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility.	2.7121465831118354
We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.	2.0542955977270525
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002.	2.912153075792203
Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance.	1.5829365220231124
Mr President, you said during last week ' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	2.0860831102835315
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	2.613401942483013
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.	1.7738988394982822
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too.	2.665661994204175
Protection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interests	2.065654953780745
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.	3.0137752769062405
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	2.1781009331951195
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	2.561689808366122
Madam President, the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one.	2.961150198400058
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.	2.4862826378910916
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.	1.91319603267786
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	2.035062565885364
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.	2.109965970878141
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union ' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	1.9793823716494872
Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why.	2.1656767667828114
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	2.5990007310191796
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	2.295122593318127
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	2.3249925413473145
Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement.	1.7901648049585364
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government ' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.	2.0604198227203203
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.	2.55098219083807
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment.	2.386192164202584
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	2.538676975775554
The other parties are not paying.	3.0759424110220897
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	1.9802298078416696
What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market.	1.9110051189624937
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva.	3.261073708561499
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract.	2.138621430714591
Mr President, I would like to offer a few explanations.	2.4839761710001143
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown.	2.8467454486905788
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	2.455897838564843
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	2.1635113234537546
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	2.072395251762472
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	1.9843028162776775
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	1.9941567096220443
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	2.6419622037296975
In connection with this, we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well.	2.3725109632774544
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	2.4066650002776955
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women ' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today ' s debate.	2.053052990385419
Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency.	1.924684519070084
At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.	1.8074183275699947
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean.	2.2947136962526486
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	1.861308734151753
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	1.9902375988020673
In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate.	3.2514243772060842
Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments.	3.147907111231419
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	2.0315619504325397
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.	2.681354264707108
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	2.4164343200306693
Of course, the story of the Erika seems comical.	2.1564094309683246
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	1.8789004685869144
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper 's proposals on the authority.	2.919126767741657
The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians.	2.907064159059206
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.	1.8867058353523536
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 and 16.	2.2793175302986284
(Applause from the PSE Group)	1.2204981788506526
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	2.6349864206321194
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.	2.3369630545671547
My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus.	1.8998407869057181
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems.	2.060904757504876
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.	2.956392851889061
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.	2.2000745420363166
Agenda	1.0773763300143226
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments.	2.4924648367654036
As regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism.	2.349153906613254
The European Union ' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.	2.154792178410313
Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds.	1.6160647336149474
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.	2.6186672774452506
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments.	1.7745018090397076
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	2.0731280360796696
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.	2.15355134302678
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	2.2497970742027458
As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money.	1.881768905101341
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.	2.439345314522481
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	3.3069291000076997
Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month.	2.0251973753007064
The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit.	2.3587633441567664
Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000)	1.6077474946979036
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	1.995402877331339
Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities.	2.0031505614730776
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	2.9911347893924285
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	2.6376418734953706
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.	2.4394431187232493
By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon.	1.9374664330242146
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.	3.070638125148539
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different.	2.1844063422349054
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.	3.3873798837561147
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue.	2.5517912176599347
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.	2.437373655091937
Furthermore, it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water, between different river basins, practically impossible in the future.	1.8269684615894843
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.	3.0438699654085433
Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States.	2.3946251111577093
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	2.2668234661149143
By then, my children will be older than I am now.	1.8245189954743097
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	2.552279739789939
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council.	2.4451679284871832
This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal.	2.037341779622536
When it comes to tourism, we can no longer do what we like where we like.	2.056806913979881
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	1.9969922786585392
Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands.	2.6525530879223718
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens ' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.	2.5014627696821314
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	2.244995993145895
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme.	2.1549493606911936
So I welcome it as such.	2.2870010243512207
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	2.1597749710854317
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	1.928512436784808
For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level.	2.598311182758708
A company is pilloried one day and not the next.	2.3239436381885765
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars.	2.9510573471745927
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements.	2.094248033451124
We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State, which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature.	2.494890599065925
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	2.390477204369085
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	2.4088939491189088
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.	2.655192602281451
I understand this.	4.32000401796777
Hence his disappearance of over one month.	1.6461218480209066
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	1.950980299362775
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.	2.2768724423913427
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	2.5092595593205043
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency ' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.	2.3449957745194085
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.	1.949580776744071
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.	1.7493791032928498
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop.	3.4280222237517597
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	2.162042729633629
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.	2.9143588267058234
. (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.	2.651567512971704
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.	2.8775100336631323
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	2.473123270969031
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.	2.180597945740332
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.	1.8997736704620996
Macedonia did not go through a war.	1.795027025145934
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives.	2.088946666722455
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.	2.332119178037753
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	2.3494657943723896
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing.	3.0240550397888195
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	1.7816483863088999
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.	2.0416077706629636
Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands.	1.4050606714850793
For safety ' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman ' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	2.8608922451552568
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health.	2.0378988275694945
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.	2.040926636089973
WIPO treaty	1.3560980454648672
This regulation is purely instrumental.	3.172634332173888
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union ' s relations with Cambodia.	2.4845561307535684
It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days.	2.1724566338638
The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up.	2.132168567029923
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.	1.9698642960283073
The first country is Indonesia.	3.3282206222383417
And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.	2.1031007820894594
We must live with our consciences."	3.005042470777494
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking.	2.927314636594062
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.	2.619520602922223
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	2.01347166843665
I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity.	2.0755774341733177
The message contained in the joint text is still valid.	3.594175815902158
We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU.	2.3927232660904916
They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels.	2.369169347786635
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.	2.076400440071394
They have our full support.	2.366504734545754
If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem?	1.9247130887621091
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.	2.5927820912746067
These costs are not very high.	2.72031294637438
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ?	1.9423968517215158
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	1.9699047093390394
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	1.9984446194556724
One of the EU ' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners.	2.210066770068653
Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered.	2.0709671166693355
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	2.6633079466554097
It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time.	2.711183338772506
The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.	2.8259870333259935
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	2.5599624500128133
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.	2.096861670524645
Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation.	2.1462569785484793
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	2.0399482925419474
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	2.2215077885693106
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty.	2.252994188534592
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	2.255896892450821
Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s.	2.141344410772047
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	2.2280134231942244
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	1.6031330040255543
How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission ' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees ' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc?	2.6250096935885847
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard.	3.098857456808924
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria.	2.702036248676281
I refer to point 9.	3.2941663888863495
Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction.	1.7957954009797463
It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested.	1.7149384952408706
. (EL) On reading the Commission ' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality.	2.461877643321466
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	4.0706126438377535
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity.	2.5290194581487433
But above all, the human rights policy is too fragmented.	3.0970983108862242
So much for the political aspect.	2.34205085837771
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action.	2.782616764500986
This latter point is of particular importance.	2.5700279331978355
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.	1.9579690959820963
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	2.7492650752010817
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement.	2.432532425305321
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	2.5512462489958128
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.	3.0818656700907163
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.	3.0201889175494925
Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States.	1.543413375811547
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	2.0645856301159617
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	2.9677037923744063
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	1.8845782577412054
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	2.19327490622672
They see us restricting each other 's liberties.	1.9924209384351501
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East.	1.7606177532161267
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	2.3118073523102747
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	2.805522197661894
Change in the law is fundamental.	1.556931648956614
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	2.3736715593404987
This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation. This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish.	2.4929855031694834
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.	2.124393307878469
(Applause from the left. Heckling from the right)	1.489621721173618
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	1.7486695824109493
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition.	2.327900570233606
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe 's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.	2.2007418822799627
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	2.7854589690119673
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union.	2.3217522369593473
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.	2.282225989773129
Mr President, I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture.	2.585000190304059
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities.	2.0830615533774033
Such a rule is only normal.	1.79134918244166
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report.	1.7584047069023327
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	2.0334598174859058
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	2.2107797661069357
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	2.74581918343264
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	2.4860898651198333
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	2.525412249372174
Agreement on comitology	1.558700539181662
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	3.1763825539762562
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	2.879408786272425
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	2.513669884424359
Not to use women ' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.	2.1159082243221645
According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned.	2.048907838214033
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	2.7411737621269503
Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank.	2.5644855469525782
But seriously.	3.6997623342583923
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.	2.2820745017920423
At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it.	2.0388206465927907
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	2.0254943784828123
Brussels knows best.	1.496766016914857
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.	1.9791544492984838
There is as yet no federal European tax.	2.1634971449087383
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.	2.2414292114762873
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion.	2.0681498932679165
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms.	2.6236609082141924
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	3.3270899990769327
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance ' .	1.9660860971878413
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.	3.271902939954373
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position.	2.8947669095827906
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.	2.6784127878915776
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs.	3.0054016953510985
Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts.	2.6502585723312544
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	2.5951814706949397
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.	2.2639593400887743
Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	2.245819197190368
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.	2.2537330320763345
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	2.570888505327304
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision.	2.5304561304393545
That service will open on 1 May this year.	2.1851701533205383
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	2.179495773694923
This is the change we must impose on the Commission ' s action.	2.764753765312313
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):	1.8243806489681902
We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms.	2.531371538197183
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups.	2.477859864165485
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling.	2.677600460109443
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern.	2.600527747459445
The joint debate is closed.	2.7089246804683826
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.	2.748176590233522
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	2.257257074189502
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	2.2984245393094973
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context.	2.291318941709655
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance.	2.6939641163948025
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened.	2.4300341071346656
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission.	2.8304743191131982
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stands for.	2.233351407435023
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.	2.125342437859273
In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.	1.7666532898172431
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	2.431552652193122
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously ' called autonomous.	1.8621367317144617
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	2.562951253749445
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.	3.716179945557336
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.	2.5423146412808397
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.	2.411744166847981
The Left ' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision ' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere.	2.385938116060734
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	1.8852158355333855
However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.	1.9480027882680973
This would then give us, for Wednesday ' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights ' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs.	2.103741776615961
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.	2.45744382730423
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively.	2.7691486427207126
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	2.3182911305878946
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.	2.705704135155326
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	1.943361566003123
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	2.2155637986100762
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.	3.2107522248891156
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	2.193385938704595
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	2.287842846337078
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	3.0529823255698387
Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union.	2.5767094857407913
Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment.	2.1085896471494014
We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender.	2.176978184951149
Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union.	2.762329246361602
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	1.6774821008792673
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed.	3.869742484637533
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	2.268105177540692
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	2.1815382740500224
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured.	1.84107052271899
We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets.	2.671505678594306
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.	1.352188369003367
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal, and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC, SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal, is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries, in areas such as education or health.	2.1876747213302323
So we come back to the previous problem.	2.91119847231671
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.	1.8290733080158614
From that standpoint, Aphrodite ' s island, as Cyprus is known, and the pirates ' island, as we islanders say of Malta with great affection, are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay.	1.8653222209638332
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.	3.373828916074723
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.	1.6451599926460618
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates.	2.572631287253365
However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999.	2.205820648544758
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.	2.4122252160776654
It is true that Mozambique ' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them.	2.228018702802918
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	1.634861707040512
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	2.1426334434822962
Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA.	2.1832533943857717
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed.	1.9530194356855066
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests.	1.606741314209873
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	2.08572984463654
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	1.8117324200644402
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	2.5126000150592165
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission.	2.8776300738739073
The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.	2.4201841737945444
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)	1.3818520161918022
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	1.6440909500659564
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.	1.626067064044038
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.	2.125619971531231
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	2.383194096222642
I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions.	2.347317199916266
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference.	2.303785633446531
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons.	2.4940923429092146
Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.	2.639696772187072
Nothing has happened!	1.4942040629471252
But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.	1.7501075579612002
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.2577405407921134
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	2.6404042497062523
Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS)	1.8781702421991138
This indicates that we have a broad consensus.	4.43083277577379
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs.	2.6179489513884775
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	2.419970900348289
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.	2.2211781931058745
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.	2.6041317211473194
It lasted only five months.	3.0417404435547417
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.	2.9715592631939725
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.	2.3778212141188395
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	2.573883057731366
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	2.586854538214658
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	2.190276514044686
First, streamlining.	2.2691024554056467
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.	4.0736994225371905
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable ' .	1.7373152217868448
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.	2.332100610660206
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.	2.059014260050379
I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure.	3.0959337957325275
My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too.	2.6449185777055217
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	2.049575539926008
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.	1.9382458946665693
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.	1.9277327460670313
In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion.	2.173367187669714
We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope.	2.2063167240029555
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets.	1.723448097004252
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random.	2.269125670089689
Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector.	1.933817143067356
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments.	2.109171810900272
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey ' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	2.620298235994355
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	2.19139072932221
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	2.127994293524249
The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition.	2.306202259048555
The women ' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light.	2.8642925504309393
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	2.292215808455244
Thirdly, we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention, how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively.	1.7466257880496359
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought.	2.6763234252550476
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.	1.4548646741936664
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round.	2.2829841140240927
I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU.	2.5776013014135857
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	1.9616255819904658
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems.	2.1656867476587363
He is a dangerous man.	2.295145018145624
Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks.	1.4908757688710064
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano ' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament.	2.351139506005194
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	2.441784401139497
The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets.	2.934071630260952
Most companies hate competition.	1.870267621775544
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential.	1.5900829170870938
The common position stipulates 2006.	2.9504413719320577
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States ' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer.	3.9880461056632495
Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003.	2.0700760607492446
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	3.187723448501531
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	2.1006921986135416
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.935748292827478
The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty.	3.014376794842142
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.	1.7557089734642544
It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations.	2.281899832969739
Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one.	3.7644661712222387
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market.	2.1846777326064295
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter.	2.4809478882714378
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.	2.116780843329151
If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made.	2.0693853841061958
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue.	2.6812587409896644
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.	1.8916319322823894
This is unacceptable to my mind.	2.740497513056568
In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.	2.5074960248384084
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.	2.4771301002399775
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too.	2.425717460907833
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round.	2.322865389059516
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research ' context.	2.7227676693143072
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information.	2.8023015299882013
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	1.302369841064632
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent.	1.9656992020533504
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	2.560280793770088
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Böge ' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament ' s temporary BSE Committee.	2.7321553949664974
In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property.	2.1984352409942747
That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people.	2.519897837197577
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.57721729940516
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	3.0085812085848747
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses.	1.405760465322008
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text.	1.9693512855329174
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission ' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	2.6176960207814473
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	2.0848619153741725
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers.	1.6583063947241947
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council.	2.383365622038822
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products.	2.074360270746212
We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up.	2.3843567066916
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	1.673908751845793
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	2.074167008366731
But if we are to secure the public ' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	2.443771419195245
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President ' s cabinet.	2.2932007962406993
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry.	1.914834611271862
Company restructuring in Europe	1.5276289006085475
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.	1.6302221833203594
We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts.	2.2947742826546116
These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us.	2.930202201106008
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	1.8077003607540338
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.	1.9107068967118002
May I say something about costs.	1.7904953782045947
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment.	2.4058244960255424
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	1.9212628797416633
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.	2.5870122638003163
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	3.3069840380422213
And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues: firstly, comitology, an ongoing debate within this House, but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament.	1.9279830553101411
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	2.6364228746898335
In any case, the authoritative version is always, of course, the original language version.	2.436184003088083
For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission. This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods.	2.1858223914006776
The Council 's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas.	3.1692084820826762
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	2.367245146818432
For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.	2.1906356724873204
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	2.697784039239394
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	2.5002912274093774
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	2.090588714591378
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.	2.097963736951166
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	2.398734623556973
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe.	2.4806608145653763
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	1.8922647945556397
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	2.1758417558662906
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials ' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	2.19184465080099
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.	2.607170465277824
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number.	2.8915717398705505
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.	2.114202854337856
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements, as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone!	2.948840589072459
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle.	1.3781499888095758
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.	2.5003526953038797
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region ' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.	1.9346704933433236
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	2.280123288509138
There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive.	2.202888933854935
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation.	2.1775081288715246
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.	2.7846742830452498
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency.	2.858411024176131
Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force.	2.332499414048848
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence.	2.087638640161924
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.	2.7282423597245464
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	1.926564972346225
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.	1.9576070744709435
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	2.1250180739912476
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro.	2.557418127371784
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	2.6274494585333508
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.	2.1281161632286936
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell.	2.555571122594276
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.	2.22998143035003
Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical.	1.9831488351004516
In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport.	1.95795689941154
What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation.	2.4394127195901993
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	2.409135050764049
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	2.4666641044015347
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.	2.6138404089039318
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened.	2.0753402898778424
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	2.2073645658971692
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.	1.861998162675076
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	2.537359408578942
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	2.168032625599598
This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU ' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark.	2.0766496636547114
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view.	2.3126710956486027
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	2.230760153158146
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	2.427775953188791
What is your opinion on that?	2.266121589083103
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.	3.1647426166713584
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on.	2.5975817551680462
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	1.9679970385751144
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives.	1.9487918765778356
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.	2.1647572915759126
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	2.397009759012698
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union ' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives.	2.272401058585036
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	2.4843196122671056
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	2.680690512105864
By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution.	2.3461153721503942
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks.	2.0219428227605927
We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one.	2.450376524832856
Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.	2.5332557429068627
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.	2.2829027100527357
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	2.9437889034062827
Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring.	2.2318936524354513
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector.	2.486584877246584
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	2.2734525480105447
Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money.	1.7196807380632173
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail.	2.640142647754271
All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	2.3542861303564684
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy.	2.505247625713546
Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.	2.128654997201002
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way.	2.6839371727429353
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.	2.306568253557399
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	2.9528738631425115
We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local.	2.1465721421412374
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider ' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	1.845398268140207
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.	2.256881965395515
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	1.891732272271268
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):	1.7453051511156166
I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.	2.800053428764859
Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth, whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening.	1.4857058214608814
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	2.0716830058946947
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	1.8275645543457426
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.	2.8025171976697156
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	2.5371603140189705
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament ' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	2.3580331063449105
Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature.	1.5532651447972743
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law.	1.8916315328889592
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	2.135444867743311
Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation.	2.0274443447326065
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	2.0251531903910354
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.	1.8161081126657856
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.	2.2450230810420013
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union ' s blessing.	2.519803673928278
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	1.8050999428109924
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.	1.999176500104419
The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road.	2.280543001763753
The crisis in last year ' s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution.	2.361540885292688
At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo.	2.2572330234998197
Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries?	2.2706208531059446
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	2.0433042198241678
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.	1.810404997686549
Why should we add to them?	1.9405297774080745
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	2.4715596226399748
My question, which has not been answered, is why, when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether.	2.5114618916097227
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.	2.3443450429520114
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel ' s support.	2.444136565165572
Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid.	2.425643640450862
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.	2.244694846017445
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women ' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	2.1935509945759697
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.	2.177088876467229
We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.	2.7667238079733156
80% of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region.	1.9327678864485893
That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve.	2.0230086494033
Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.	2.3672932599423206
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence.	2.5861658078006085
(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	2.4553759360938976
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	1.984060542616737
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	2.18200777073613
I can partly accept Amendment No 11.	3.110478931218299
Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations.	1.9996271219723847
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	2.157052547289918
The lion ' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements.	2.0599860480996215
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	2.3115861335735177
At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before.	2.5993923029196613
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	2.199743374099478
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	1.839112108054084
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.	3.2653323780904784
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union ' s desire to communitise urban policy.	3.0928239842486644
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	2.5555030423689744
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?	2.7986054063100445
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,	1.9714882210034081
For example, at least in the countries which I know well, I doubt that the intention, repeated three or four times in the Commission document, to reform 'Europe ' s social protection, health care and pension systems <URL> a climate of more cautious public spending ' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back.	2.078451676974173
As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision.	2.9936961704876737
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.	2.060588990555928
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament ' s motions are anything to go by.	2.9786252907059443
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	2.088580461029618
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission 's position on the report.	3.91881038825426
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays ' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	2.1803727388908176
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate.	2.726984760051371
On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.	2.307540823052845
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	2.217801308132529
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.	2.5126142346394067
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.	2.212104054327245
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance.	2.352372924198316
I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances.	2.0789379925122984
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission ' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	2.529837505933753
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.	2.6341345710861486
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	2.159895246274788
That is all I have to say for the moment.	2.839014099809078
Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny.	1.8946500405627822
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	2.2905231980897858
Europe ' s message, the European Union ' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	2.676996540189596
The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation.	2.4451085936972086
Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets.	1.8633549727299232
However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee.	2.2729606553288124
In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission.	2.4695581854959237
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	2.431061458955629
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.	2.0761483406220576
Will it be omitted?	2.0815347925913024
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.	2.009020281844849
What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism?	1.8365145402772756
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe.	2.4095744830910335
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.	2.182128725588315
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	2.2734171815914133
However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure.	2.1592804353036246
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.	1.948209272171784
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate.	2.9470519674789055
I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy.	3.2290329982877153
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	2.1158246144924444
There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development.	2.164559366101874
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty dans la realité.	1.8675574140965308
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	2.0947947861133445
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.	2.028437103505183
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky ' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	1.8841288226414923
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	2.57250142670629
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	2.245965366648987
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	2.6793518322184022
I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster.	2.150573647876711
I beg to move acceptance of this report.	2.6465966313433786
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.	2.7078744819254887
At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients.	1.5633198786620535
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.	2.422070395016008
Report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999	2.0921110182754883
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	1.8070279817989137
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.	2.3281356124140453
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.	2.000411940751233
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination, which I have just mentioned, and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, by this Parliament, especially from the point of view of coherence, recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause.	2.5203871064119054
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	2.486330209248579
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	3.230940510499712
The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale.	2.680628063716987
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House.	2.199466538122303
This is why it has been around for years, and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response.	2.890478516023121
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated.	3.374299641795405
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them.	3.3593428678196586
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People ' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	2.3862873903982433
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council.	3.6673729842423204
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	2.838845680018531
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	2.658152775234164
In 1998, we had 55 murders.	2.742407275168667
We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate.	2.5339216122535793
Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne.	2.073848333899025
This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens.	2.4097531101753984
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	3.3583634973817187
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament 's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.	2.1446300787313564
I enthusiastically support the report 's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	2.1771751785304647
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	2.7102079200525147
It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff.	2.0604239156940496
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee ' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings.	2.1564672338136157
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?	1.8235015610311023
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.	2.159324964940063
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.	2.722143706010736
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	1.6519739745988273
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.	2.468226016761053
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries ' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	1.933170362431808
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success.	2.5721346013204567
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	1.9819722439702168
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.	1.8652058640587137
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	2.41872449029012
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	2.4818125461283427
We need stronger banking supervision.	2.9700790048628423
Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.	1.96781989153501
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.	2.332888382964429
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors.	2.2427619242914485
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	3.3301900196161394
You can be what you want to be.	2.4382231948749435
This can only benefit our credibility.	2.606380976725404
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	1.7303126722968538
I am far keener to see us move away from today 's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg.	1.790859963422251
Where would Europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture?	2.041986671415602
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.	2.3826839140648124
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area.	2.768361752349828
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions.	2.3508843654822793
The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay.	2.2999294382965916
We must take the best from each of our countries.	3.07867146822462
I do not have these concerns.	3.4809763121752466
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?	1.8529935985844732
Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.	2.5605168246647536
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today ' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	2.1810570812362933
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	2.0738278734636504
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.	2.322344089235679
(FR) The Commission ' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.	1.9913021801689135
In a sense this is where its work begins.	2.5759093635430528
The stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various Member States, despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit.	2.9718651300125374
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions.	2.3230549178264615
Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.	2.2840533681293946
By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.	2.1967643035139965
Mr President, I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM, our national airline company.	2.246497115424009
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all?	2.7017908108360382
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.	2.303056204740642
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.	2.846949402919418
Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares?	2.397476650448002
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.	2.960030860828445
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	2.3130005302219176
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	1.7476183760529596
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	2.413056008116313
It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and, therefore, to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy.	2.0667446670195293
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	2.7860607628730762
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	2.0929855282094643
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria.	1.6898303389998581
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force?	2.2185937179717845
There is no room for amendments.	2.3327628126837916
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities.	2.009778684400648
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	2.3860666756020015
If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused.	2.2163617711328474
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.	1.9049902290057057
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure.	2.1934327425045184
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	2.0422772406208303
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3647183468043427
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.	2.194118249265673
Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member.	2.1275914429921428
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	1.9067579235739263
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	2.4588186434011985
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	2.641077041040389
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	2.858267135593508
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.	3.1731688118416748
What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate.	2.406503487874921
My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have?	1.8045602206825893
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.	2.44574697470611
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.	2.6385751544926648
What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government.	2.0110627827859195
That is a fact of life.	2.641068542693026
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States ' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	2.2861958877869575
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.	2.7547526842667205
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	1.9515610451692844
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.	2.416867926931178
I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs.	1.509251546871211
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case.	2.139717845238812
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI.	2.2858570914978658
They will take a long time, as we are finding out.	2.679479972164067
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.	2.828435930059861
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries ' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union ' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.	2.4439234352332524
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	2.7885089897193898
On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts.	2.0403099076965323
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up?	2.5320674984519043
As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets.	1.8738204934210672
In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	2.4604130291008994
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.	2.7293354169694397
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament ' s proposals.	2.1978715850082353
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	2.357246458624566
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	2.666478393360485
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia	2.3127330891922817
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	1.9854051238863142
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it.	2.000559475203471
The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves.	2.25268787971311
The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa.	2.3446025049843127
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.	2.6435926578670945
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration ' , as others too have said here.	2.3186890554952395
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	2.8589340625327013
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement ' [no turning back].	2.167092670256323
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.	2.1566403005029304
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government.	2.4253916293968842
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.	1.8252311013839464
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.	2.063416019675833
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	2.0321919459925883
I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.	2.155523011173775
One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality.	1.70560495177996
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource.	2.3883058164884376
The same applies to labour market policy.	3.132270218802089
I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.	2.542779313894368
Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue?	2.640452245711851
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.	2.2061258451253
We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported.	2.8519810656128675
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements.	1.6800976830201024
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.	2.2119588634171294
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as "Europe 's scapegoat" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive.	1.8646246518616583
We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies.	2.1702871232397833
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.	3.120621910472417
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):	1.7453051511156166
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe.	1.8139013458484803
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft.	2.1396102341711907
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO.	2.8435011849850316
The Commission ' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.	2.8856795540882985
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.	2.0826233684601876
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	2.140292218447957
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources	1.3211072500240004
Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough.	1.8007555892186338
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.	2.0077767545853384
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.	2.508585797190108
.	1.374839594702952
It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail.	1.9463116322428733
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage.	2.6560974173146534
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.	1.8609248196837598
And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines.	2.3968995591068984
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger.	1.863961305540929
This too is unacceptable in my view.	2.327790869949229
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	2.129780246779076
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	2.5893585485743857
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.	3.4439052075756016
And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action.	2.0732264437951273
Agriculture and health: we see the issue differently from the Commission: in our view there are no consumers: there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health, quality and respect for the environment.	1.9440380578438374
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	2.4597053298211615
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	2.604694147211305
Will they also take part in our defence policy?	2.175351684365198
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	2.209039998658305
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.	1.9195826722736056
Today, nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems, with Internet at the sharp end, mobile telephones and digital television, are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models.	1.890296478196254
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	2.1317867641430435
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino ' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.	2.4239230664131477
I am certain, therefore, that an island such as Malta, with its population of 340 000 cannot accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater.	1.955867947199684
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made, we, the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common vision and, in particular, the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament.	2.882069541907353
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right.	2.4968233540500897
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	2.0223556976512156
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries ' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	2.3543619924255355
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.	2.7223768971275124
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards.	2.366652251220639
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	2.302148084247736
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	2.3129794573560445
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	2.442955144013282
What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party?	1.87698188110713
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union ' s institutions.	2.7654264562246316
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	2.826033728298904
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy.	3.6995221385971306
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens.	2.1122706009979653
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	2.1885399458703536
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion.	2.394024792665144
Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.	1.2379729469215663
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	2.915934751480099
In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves.	2.021276007252069
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds.	2.929365252178709
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission ' s humanitarian aid policy.	3.0046067752465855
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.	2.0736992110830683
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	2.5507210835917773
Finally, we consider that tourism can, in addition to being a growth factor, be a factor for democracy, and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear, conscious commitment.	2.5098532156452484
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	2.479087142348996
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	1.9640108221572616
The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States.	2.2249383789330097
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	2.19557878057436
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	2.0876022802494356
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	2.275804095829173
However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority.	2.2848823561125635
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission ' s staff.	2.7583913388604584
I therefore welcome the Commission ' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie.	3.248063213352511
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves.	3.0316989247619888
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology.	2.413280824453188
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person ' s ethnic origin.	1.688578486565957
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	3.05055168093428
A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands.	1.837620226562918
If nothing is done now, we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste.	2.8633133748070145
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.	2.074449865978374
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.	2.4310562308540113
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	2.3191839939943026
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with.	2.2570590055478594
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.	1.353667572290587
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	2.154316439646205
With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct.	2.388376392626483
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	2.8284664433695643
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.	2.7488821611348784
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	2.8316864120802383
Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today ' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone.	2.5312218647089066
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.	1.3591257215191561
The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million.	2.218028241455653
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	2.35884172057364
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.	3.1535804335661592
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	2.7810306395189803
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union.	2.1447780127533287
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	2.191767526661458
We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity, but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world. This means that its resources for coping with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non-existent.	2.4098559339120156
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.	2.166905762202534
Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible.	2.746928810630674
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.	2.8970430218043943
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.	2.09270275505991
Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.	2.063373988686502
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	2.7578872273722284
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle.	2.7114137208620632
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	1.9965379975571718
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions.	2.026275956932919
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	2.4112794649661318
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	2.4346221034466753
However, Mrs Lienemann ' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.	2.1509881018446144
My third point has also been mentioned already.	2.5281205376976144
Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	2.6188076390232093
Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.	2.082903635148517
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.	2.2072832386724586
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.	2.6625176283695664
I may have missed it in the list she gave out.	3.199022066434498
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon.	2.5404711498097443
(DA) Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.	1.7478311072765813
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents ' era and their parents ' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live.	1.8951447250145972
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.	1.997090739838293
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.	1.7349498589128711
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	2.2965497337078746
Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.	2.073944668562352
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	2.37199818331156
There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe.	1.8219689902788183
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU.	2.2298402594819686
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.	2.6906016096446743
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure.	3.127477630161144
The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	2.2262933106511813
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	1.6817004818048138
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	2.0448645220661095
Question Time (Council)	1.8469571105543827
There are four more sister ships in service at present.	1.9810825408090231
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled.	2.5913160133835365
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	2.5675928407909843
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time.	2.263463344599799
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent.	2.123527634257054
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.	2.5545220944148195
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement.	2.228410660405251
Since the Belgian Government ' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial.	1.9728983461307037
Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public ' s range of savings options.	1.6203960895246254
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants.	2.073794331946345
This is the theory behind it, anyway.	2.4305206238141324
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship ' s sides mechanically.	2.3153261375022893
I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House.	1.8548863502328006
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	2.271171963854516
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	2.3801666881151844
Having said this, the EU ' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region.	1.8589118657196644
Europe ' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia, the Far East and America.	1.9745629902502213
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement.	3.344797411363847
Mr President, Commissioner, before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would like to share with you three basic factors which, in my opinion, determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment.	2.3098142741513605
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament 's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union 's food safety regime.	2.7355128545204854
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.	1.9246870170626524
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	1.9458068523200718
It will be voting against it.	3.0054363360531418
The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	1.8588804125919642
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal ' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.	1.8582507480130883
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe ' s status in the international system.	2.603057241462048
Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe,	2.7821662713168647
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.	2.467092392237077
Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party.	1.7819665500180277
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework.	3.948987033482596
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.	2.3960143418335633
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers.	2.3680730544776885
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	2.027202102794848
In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law.	2.1943706100257803
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	2.2463352998573836
Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice ' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.	2.0599520928463178
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	2.946535096925801
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.	2.301089343456894
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998.	1.8267033654049338
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency.	2.6034920887702366
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.026994319655814
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China.	2.172951543476544
May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas.	2.589180127782625
In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present.	2.280711172586506
Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment.	1.7755264656039453
I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice.	2.6608203194601376
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	2.754701427119879
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	2.198122991248092
But they might accidentally do great damage.	2.235214073666414
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.	2.0833258287021117
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.	2.7057062143367165
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	1.645351857986302
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	2.4714345107181432
In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People ' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources.	2.264891879481376
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.601129037475729
Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?	2.212001607573735
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians.	1.5982492087770934
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	2.692532967762668
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	2.0914781266607756
Turning to judicial cooperation, in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings.	2.2635170582914372
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union ' s common foreign and security policy.	3.178952848785068
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	2.0729224985734938
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.	1.9515657776176039
I say this just so that we know where we stand.	3.2865503704047394
In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union ' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context.	2.6874808520352893
The Community ' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	2.667299070267744
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world.	2.2306663830532187
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives.	1.6584904165905539
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	2.4130753890342627
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996.	1.3324238734814278
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.	2.7996258234085136
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe.	3.348378487397928
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	1.9362515090678056
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	1.6054990614407314
Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries.	2.0138628441017175
As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported.	1.887222006112265
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	2.719499300831892
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.	2.6094723010581524
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.	2.240413673598791
In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.	2.001948436189033
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system.	2.7355153377098866
There is one wish on the European Parliament ' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies.	2.807308977936429
I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi 's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy.	2.5024338059978595
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	2.335009440555085
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	1.5413989284572898
It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years.	1.9792116250978844
But that does not take away from the fact that the report ' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	3.2639215939198727
Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050?	1.958575899446903
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	2.361249030886431
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.	2.30451169636937
Even within my group, the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion.	1.8398862202106294
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region!	2.698265048298226
The market is a law unto itself.	2.7998929327674285
The postal services are important.	3.5173556082319126
In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others.	2.11352419481292
The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public.	2.142800531271819
I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.	2.6544363020169532
Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour.	2.2585271459304908
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	2.1090112875983626
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.	2.131630895875527
Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified.	1.9064677272079962
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.	2.1233115505886624
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	2.2723765822481226
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally.	2.178882200293519
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society?	2.7171945465602154
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future.	3.0226831837746877
I would also like to remind Members that, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition, which is an important point - sooner or later, as part of its own pre-accession strategy, have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time, and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety.	2.360330851104819
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.	2.2808237932329916
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	2.179276790226874
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board.	2.366888018076244
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life ' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	2.2258839608980376
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.	2.1825587386735767
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	1.8961279908939892
. (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate.	1.81272489818508
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good.	3.0554262171919246
However, I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution.	3.5365643590302036
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	2.546188165520516
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	2.353957612322156
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	2.534762771185144
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised.	2.526836495579536
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States.	2.143077966680264
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6008080479545364
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention.	2.7953464863840414
- (FR) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety.	2.6237366073328614
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	2.2537984546483414
With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive.	1.7784356305371103
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.	1.7334824257778902
In that case, the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity.	2.435840233897913
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	2.0357216419323514
Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report.	2.3735372571690037
We know that you have an important role in this.	3.0942362925670612
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.	2.228217424511359
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.	2.188764112494703
We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and, what is more, concepts.	2.251925444455201
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.	2.6590087152354633
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States ' policies with the European Union ' s development policy.	2.5457603144270196
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.	2.4201382245632828
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament ' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	2.1937178586099257
Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party.	2.5761785897257057
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	2.8065643499342814
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.	2.9330361587763227
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	2.121017394782894
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this.	2.8859325243498493
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	2.1181141834151562
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.	2.8709159238585475
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.	2.480566583545959
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible.	2.043800291404035
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.	2.594894658187186
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	2.482317976176224
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or, in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around, the manufacturer, has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with ecology; it is a simple question of competition!	2.350153068390604
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas.	2.6604834086003604
I do not know whether this is in order, and I would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the House.	2.472811596165805
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	2.5139794141562137
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity.	2.8697660055582244
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	2.125689560896929
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe 's response to the BSE crisis.	2.231147351044139
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	2.3302254373672358
They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive.	2.153433792122782
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts.	2.834090152273474
Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions.	1.9457513259641404
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta?	1.7697072463854286
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	2.0311282108664264
The words 'issued by ' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities ' .	2.7998225220393618
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.	2.6935646199994907
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	2.505345214132878
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	2.1865719980494824
And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us.	2.2863939282214405
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	2.410056384880552
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	2.2056083060822544
I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	2.7027404407706306
I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long.	1.8342502281344946
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	1.9607782331157166
Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report	1.59353688590166
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.	2.4236092636692046
As the report itself indicates, the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period, which were already low, at EUR 900 million. Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.	2.1340731990709694
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	2.5578944577161633
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.	2.2396906859655297
We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back.	2.062151654231217
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.	2.1058461685381578
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.	1.9615867033322048
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.	2.4515216973250316
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	2.737382633150671
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.	2.3741390057725993
Mr President, there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security, freedom and justice.	2.8678865431471308
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control.	1.9275067954253857
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	2.6899938973889093
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	3.066480578423131
For five years, I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation, which assuredly does not have Parliament ' s broad perspective.	3.136194254843325
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission 's Green Paper on food law was published.	2.5779365294994476
For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.	2.4054735735978623
Whatever the Eurosceptics say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.	1.9949928727422364
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	2.262392032430978
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.	2.269495877557962
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly.	2.2777373897595337
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.	2.352190021477684
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	2.4548288260087774
Mr President, I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on Budgets, and the Commission, and we can assure you that, for our part, we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties.	2.6310972988778842
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	2.0028328896108305
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns.	2.2134635017521576
An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.	1.8622892008151721
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	2.2496495913284105
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.	1.9358314265671435
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	2.1172694221559922
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	2.6029502583389434
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.	1.8050179565507867
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.	2.4370517451860687
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	2.096321883304854
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.	2.3718925925831957
Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime.	1.7857920249425454
They have all been persuaded!	2.3140781393732412
Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.	2.4288159895322052
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence.	2.821096559288379
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	2.280656238424499
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	2.5073033914216
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	1.7233917119467053
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams, even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue.	1.6687311070711253
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission ' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	2.3921426634000635
I agree completely.	4.238161235454401
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.	2.670950943790043
Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union ' s postal services.	3.2429718874210938
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	2.313522312469644
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely.	2.1069127724494514
Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair ' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council ' s macho position on Austria.	2.3008474790087874
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.	2.3491534722669463
He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning ' s meeting.	2.2809405704901784
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)	1.5540944303769562
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not.	2.2882804544055606
So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.	3.414049992347519
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.	2.5389074701380814
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	2.157850505215754
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid.	2.5200185030648314
It is therefore important that the manufacturer ' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	2.566834872183099
Are there any comments?	1.2644728256185398
These days, someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field.	2.0247901647968565
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind.	2.752861150511879
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed.	2.6437699977824707
I would urge you to endorse this.	3.012580191546368
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	3.0016475402735208
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us.	2.642523121364053
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough.	2.6081727949012277
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy.	2.0402876360014317
As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State.	2.59989892469035
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there.	3.199576035994866
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	1.7395762240703971
It is thanks, too, to Parliament ' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens ' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale.	2.588139389399943
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention.	2.204963752826975
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?	2.4135586250938252
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	2.1342895043892187
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	2.8006450152045907
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	2.1321549791798984
But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation.	2.28183579452971
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world.	2.4895241501802357
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	1.9931129816775852
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well.	2.0791338437886333
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	2.051068073980763
In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies, so that it could form an opinion, and asked the European confederations of hotel-and-restaurant owners and tourist agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them.	1.9430609815350026
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.	3.029185932811072
As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States.	2.1807124370869992
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	1.888911927549242
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	2.4835467404056257
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility.	2.1908591251900367
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.	3.02244070593254
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	2.3415343573826752
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	2.0472809573882222
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	1.795723878559476
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	2.186502754064497
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.	2.5466223674459023
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week ' s debate.	2.2213003990990994
The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle.	2.863720118015415
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.	2.5826291054309776
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission ' s legislative programme.	2.5765951191926573
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations.	2.6070933342525517
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	2.515022629042772
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	2.4891423878151415
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis. Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work.	1.886310402597943
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	2.0020562815337
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses.	2.079298532047948
Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements.	2.17357882719038
We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats.	2.8101651349400067
Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient.	1.8377442919908549
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.	2.651793586898542
The European Union is a system based on law.	2.8332691897024245
In more general terms, this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants.	2.1540612355938515
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	2.2047005661741235
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	2.3786688357959065
At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking.	2.117371738732465
I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.	2.0297409004908027
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position.	2.768968689718409
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	1.5049760104360552
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?	1.6749853975008073
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	2.652801354538064
The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105.	1.694272719841942
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality.	2.5955666575150103
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	2.6340329899469137

My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas?	2.075715790429668
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.	1.9849997950589657
) Mr President, I voted for the Council 's strategy for modernising social protection because, in my view, it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation, although it does not actually go the whole way.	2.424251124501002
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.	2.04064609219267
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.	2.3917826643777653
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	2.4642702706157285
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	2.1369197257447805
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.	3.990622348408071
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me, is not enough, in practical terms, to allow any type of project to be carried out.	1.733296923324047
. and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	2.2252883438503193
I say they have a right to solidarity.	3.3259930145984926
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about.	2.8117943939183494
Indeed, for some 'forestry ' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.	1.7798776592382135
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.	2.2064346992422124
This is not the case here.	3.0376651932410486
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.	1.8808295497007426
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	2.0343393048691323
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording.	2.617029260216385
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related.	2.359556481789491
Report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( 'Culture 2000 ') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)	1.669133890019841
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	1.8450768001111415
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	1.731899532967256
The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors.	2.3746303461231
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.	2.3315339481128907
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle ' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	2.4227286374218586
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	2.5066699985048744
The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	2.022103959965526
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions.	1.653579069099136
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.	1.8509424958955003
Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.	2.9538330352664435
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.	2.599258306573998
These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms.	2.2035747558622756
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.	2.809801755164024
Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.	1.4702884403389473
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services.	2.117042127327819
When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions.	1.959363382697857
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	2.196557510025504
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	2.5433351794335786
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	1.573524021651773
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe?	2.097796770547329
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	2.79923663925256
The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations.	2.5987039759583856
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	2.1906523474892454
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken.	2.4000073667033957
We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.	2.2673706393892705
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation.	2.2942153798659364
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	1.670518348332505
However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes.	1.78724634993323
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	3.3443885965169335
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.	2.5471561177927984
So a great deal has to be done in this area.	3.597881673246069
Is this actually how we want things done?	1.925892467966054
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	2.1644375699988303
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.	2.605371275815197
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.	2.681449328791406
But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107.	1.4706977471218654
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.	2.866169443271336
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	2.312904442633302
However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons.	2.4704879197553065
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	3.384894379915799
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned.	2.2671896047792797
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice.	1.8319165701602769
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	2.8340500072481505
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is.	2.2795178347819838
I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries.	2.8279374740895666
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.	2.208125089817774
The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund.	2.94217412070196
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	2.1230081008971524
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	2.4519903160570244
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.	1.855148985099838
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	1.884278424268575
But I should like to stress the fact that, on this issue of the environment, the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal.	2.895430552157742
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.	2.657134430278119
Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999.	1.510916410677939
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	2.208976692228432
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic ' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	1.824756877602839
That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.	1.7717430616753445
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.	2.9024093056915032
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	2.0470773741589756
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	3.7598447891204057
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services.	2.462315965149064
Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens.	2.3334446020864625
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.	1.817728210940879
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	2.5976408663028705
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	2.1976646462958507
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	2.4829675544803913
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.	2.193184179993952
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	2.523989970383009
For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account.	2.18692133793704
With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies.	2.2868998395270226
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	1.9380177439854913
I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which, in my view, need clarifying.	2.9729032230839323
Parliament ' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union ' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.	2.591216908873687
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	2.6319359883606146
Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000.	1.7074420410588353
As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation.	2.06852879286973
I thank them for their statements to the House.	2.788254936787394
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.	2.017584472371337
Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries.	2.22608191190115
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.	2.2257494645213
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission ' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	3.1735123788456225
It is also a matter of conviction.	4.093674796276819
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.	2.525676017270844
Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe.	2.2698904533388595
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio, and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection.	2.4534296972492986
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten ' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises.	2.3258930821566532
According to UNIFIL, there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw, which is something we welcome.	1.927531000983951
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders.	2.1137580172088946
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed.	2.9337656226237834
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	3.3548654124023103
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	2.3890406760719647
Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform.	1.648123981376458
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	1.9747652161611595
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	2.2360356128075547
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations.	1.9941890679816172
The text is overambitious, and Britain ' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	2.477940568458543
This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.	3.4030000496418755
This issue is extremely topical.	2.9502101741993467
The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances.	2.1351427882502794
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU ' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	2.0919515135732003
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April.	2.437372014658985
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.	1.6858000816028436
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis ' .	2.756178567856627
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question.	2.9608643992397146
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	1.4773090484855265
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.	2.4506663744117265
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	3.118532482423017
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	2.8452112879033753
I do not think so.	2.629998118581199
Where is the beef?	1.595419164531797
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.	3.079260832360411
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations.	2.136823513679044
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	2.1076368983699685
And these are the consequences!	3.088549421807469
If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation.	2.5189429262423495
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	2.899054550543473
Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter ' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	2.015320057566138
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6008080479545364
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	2.5164893439738707
As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described.	2.192480418287244
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament ' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.	2.3894415255332584
We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union ' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey ' s will as regards the European Union ' s priorities in its foreign relations.	2.592392278997164
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	1.8375280621852168
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament.	2.2275294700970294
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.	1.5429327570835594
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.	2.051877883889477
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	2.12303901655485
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	2.192936862254224
Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.	2.518940305937192
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	1.9882460017294372
It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there.	2.2109088759234683
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)	1.337821159902519
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	1.927571139806158
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need.	1.705065786090004
It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March.	1.9426912285127973
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.	1.8207403678011007
Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.	1.7879799730790518
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision.	2.0924111925975946
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	1.739796220252123
We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development.	2.4848853024939452
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.	1.8805665412205397
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed.	2.930351325444852
I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.	2.4422995288723053
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.	2.282226287469276
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.	2.592704547723684
If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	2.2683801970327484
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	2.0770540088703746
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	2.1121203190583437
May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	1.7067732437784955
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth.	2.0489869918162262
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	2.503776224665685
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	2.452044447290735
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	2.7029302171422014
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.	2.2153680904600583
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People ' s Democratic Republic of China.	2.216094742794868
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	2.21960979232358
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.	2.6280822831382853
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	2.7989812917780625
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.	2.9438082051492422
Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF.	1.9099883021798014
These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative, Álvaro de Soto.	2.0547555688017343
The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks.	2.8853975142481865
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly.	2.1615332051392593
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	2.3970002853067784
In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.	2.22552816235341
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	2.2170786731297585
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	2.1979670660522794
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.	1.7556855021545201
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.	2.5874585703491224
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.	2.54673727959258
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors ' meeting on Wednesday.	2.3485326227860277
I believe that the Commission ' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter.	3.3576909678695
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.	2.978673442451084
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market, only the body was being attacked. Now, it is the soul.	2.283315789942557
Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test.	2.6021272293360513
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	2.5279300797462474
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.	2.327527060937317
I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us.	2.5797908436066033
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.	1.9943150782076517
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament ' s credibility on environmental issues.	2.4481927609822245
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	2.1227819059004953
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	1.5257160460188954
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	2.5843425809060037
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.	2.065884160257675
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey ' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara ' s position on this.	2.4268524072701996
What happens in another part of the world affects us.	3.3594950016842677
I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.	1.959000446502989
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.	2.6064671834402042
B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,	1.7847078049806933
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State.	2.4594447851725434
We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base.	2.347171289082984
This is the crux of the matter.	2.067553899487666
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	2.130411923710571
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life.	2.178599154055526
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe ' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.	1.9197238749570051
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2183945468114763
I am in favour of collection free of charge.	2.7477341594276172
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	2.0981842066982317
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	1.8221318110966698
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.	1.7964583874528888
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	2.3174122561362935
Those rights are, by definition, universal.	1.8064555548218246
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	3.1099541333059553
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged.	2.1758538179850735
Thank you for your reply.	1.8799470643006613
That concludes Questions to the Commission.	2.132909468281175
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems.	2.2829145885028113
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	1.8531136043441445
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	1.4600962955915644
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.	2.254589494617221
After this interesting exchange of opinions, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing.	2.0316929565136284
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine ' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session.	2.353899245907956
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.	1.9201146009514882
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	2.9353354540916547
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	2.3141799112188033
Firstly, Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003.	2.0726149741136863
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	2.563316125578089
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too.	2.633323684591954
Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors.	2.063525274870547
Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique.	2.345794649070877
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	2.39096429072952
Mr President, Mr Katiforis ' s report is exciting.	2.5894193362247804
To do so also changes the owner ' s liability retroactively.	2.082497797096828
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.	1.9029711645782446
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	2.4412934688590946
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL.	1.9843147545893285
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean.	2.313662988189121
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity.	2.07017079003955
The vote will take place on Thursday.	2.163742432545279
. (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	2.614094927940573
However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis.	2.1538160843035867
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	2.576957909123767
We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.	2.823783115772507
That is our role and this is the point of my question.	3.42497201858583
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union!	2.523329830967102
Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past.	1.9213758387389528
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	1.7332541085983548
This is what we should be concerned about here today.	2.8911047182106393
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.	2.2466568094922774
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	2.3401583104250134
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	2.127745418942447
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case.	2.1979781340411537
In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.	2.3536067725269096
In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law.	3.2977599344751916
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.	2.0850021532110077
Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office.	1.9677500744899723
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	2.304586377782789
I am also saying this as a former environment minister.	3.0316753088393047
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities, non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces.	2.465818268588929
We are all concerned about the environment and our children ' s future.	2.8525167242517555
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.	2.8998628513451843
First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle.	2.001057236186927
Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies.	1.451915341624868
There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived.	1.9282267038036793
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	2.1580235936282475
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation.	2.200886684478796
The Commission is new and has to be given time, but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission.	2.9293332285487748
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission ' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly.	2.981891679508428
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting.	2.2362566707994334
Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.	1.97634152983494
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	1.8591826417915887
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	2.7435781574933076
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights.	2.0205913740582826
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	2.419326464594718
Did anyone find work?	1.3788428783949862
We must therefore find a political solution.	2.567555957821287
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	1.8535575307087624
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts.	1.4694755133138098
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	1.999587324772255
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.	1.9993219606551818
Most say it is about time.	2.240142413883315
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	2.182181365159348
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	1.6331153213633427
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.	1.6358894859389783
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.	1.9156673628280845
With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC.	2.672908001044765
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.	1.9512253704063955
The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers.	2.1996756583019157
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due.	2.0685011694146156
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	2.5688672684246288
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms.	1.6916554460948365
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday.	2.0647573882423353
This has not just happened.	3.1599046746771213
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	1.8051209751685475
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party!	2.012552570644372
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.	2.123593747290972
However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned.	2.756755713778653
The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission ' s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence.	2.2616549307831595
It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least.	2.707713274893421
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.	2.4270308171090846
First of all, the policy comes too late.	1.7318692932363957
I believe we can learn something from this.	3.00700707222539
- (FR) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science ' .	2.338228020398568
In other words, our rapporteur is proposing an oral amendment to add a recital reading: 'Whereas Malta and Cyprus will participate. '	1.9905230877035178
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.	1.9214325573258175
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	2.9082386705694394
We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe.	2.3637128977900637
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law.	3.05690044145371
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service.	1.7012006531787143
Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.	2.2922818814572103
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	1.8945227899029629
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets.	2.0154872345788597
The truth is though, that the Commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	3.019472301095664
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.	2.650806590139569
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue.	2.8925347129644137
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.	2.30513221401385
We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation.	2.271696281651076
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	2.240176521012197
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission ' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise ' .	2.3760360293816034
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies.	1.9794573736286296
With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area, cities are at the forefront of economic, social and cultural change in Europe.	2.1974371886344755
Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure.	1.757651082194473
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	2.688013543606403
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.	2.6147038985054314
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	2.1701594538952365
Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.	1.6406627018526354
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.	2.6904366867101257
Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising.	2.0048047126831534
So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.	1.7211661098289295
The principle also concerns water charging.	2.9884328641717093
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.	2.233632204325723
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.	1.8790380677779397
The European Commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.	2.7201791766884362
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens.	2.948705569561707
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	2.8259911968242815
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.	1.7753723684982552
For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further.	2.2227851332047575
Overly strict, unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable.	2.0909928826227713
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO ' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.	2.136343496876306
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament ' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	3.262178762199153
I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses.	2.542381214013166
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.	2.3698624617626005
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union ' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	2.309443854294542
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament ' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.1549955238898595
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	2.379091689904103
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	2.4394487970216865
I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.	2.197419120515672
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so.	2.097217121708858
However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission.	2.422488320734789
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten.	2.911976372076446
To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced.	1.672256212559791
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	2.474146065473954
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	3.5524737767164414
This is why we are abstaining.	2.858863029357337
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	2.3233838786847807
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people ' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative.	2.263896109151319
However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States.	2.1835174708821725
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.	1.6618595478427076
Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them" , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries" .	2.3526353864916505
The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme.	2.330525791042264
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.	2.471447881592106
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development.	2.5560160581662705
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product ' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.	2.345523016367566
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims ' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.	2.154688916623053
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.	3.2000142065178365
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	2.1109542114821274
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.	2.1555000637974775
We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity.	2.0352462060358545
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive.	2.6822636045124906
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.	2.2380209737868504
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides ' surrendering power.	3.271212343731912
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.	2.346553814253612
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	2.467181530145577
We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems.	2.58554343422848
Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse.	2.434062777782083
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	2.430587931241876
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.	2.3033497389021105
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	3.2661069041548982
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report should be implemented.	2.5680397018261747
What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing.	2.284717658621107
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council.	2.3963587411615164
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	3.206377671606794
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions.	2.389256833108096
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.	2.6857058689889466
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today ' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.	2.5289265543994444
It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately.	2.7035076177483623
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz ' s remarks, and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom, security and justice, without having to derogate from their own powers.	2.849037421208087
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	2.0760781719275445
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council.	2.3715731041844488
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	2.3179340019780934
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection.	2.316581641195545
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections.	2.396883010601164
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.	2.616000485945253
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.	1.939011824613231
Let me explain.	2.324315744409096
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	2.5363971614381406
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	2.807292893125364
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?	2.230815647650833
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	2.5103983451229483
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).	1.9732291502652126
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	1.89727119308858
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model.	2.3748181931806833
If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme.	2.7309085797508876
When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough.	2.0839657986731375
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	2.2412828427395413
However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive.	1.9504836631690514
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry.	2.3194871600298432
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action.	2.2247657372298497
Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway.	2.1659730727316924
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe ' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	2.547174398747853
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	1.9503424914168113
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	3.470090707834751
My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda.	2.4755567092079214
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky.	2.16956803126635
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	2.7635066665572117
I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes.	2.2009860269072514
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.	2.5121735217689434
It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again.	2.7513139143422896
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested.	2.6250172794835867
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	2.479840914372049
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April.	2.524018312488871
It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages.	2.257181471534353
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	2.3246490807794986
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, .	2.0733696198147564
We must give them this opportunity.	2.7024125828513164
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	2.2581666344692413
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.	2.3310197689894006
Unfortunately, very little.	2.199805319021999
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.	2.117790084871779
Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	1.874021408860226
Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky.	1.8566241298365809
Today ' s problems cannot be solved in five years.	1.6149862365283125
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays ' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.	2.073720781994493
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months ' time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000.	2.5338774151852324
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal:	3.320496969965719
Of course they do, but they are not unlimited.	2.360918673174321
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.	3.25278701550193
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider ' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a "Europe of shopkeepers" .	2.181747997851353
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers ' money in Europe.	2.4833216562578304
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	2.042811924432157
With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then.	2.064163298896031
Why not?	2.0120056423985493
There were women everywhere.	2.750064224907697
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it.	2.4498630089872657
It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals.	2.215003353623354
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic ' s forces in Kosovo.	1.9878274438840653
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.	1.9742167333910097
Cyprus and Malta	1.965082425460643
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country.	2.062125673122332
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	2.123624218717746
In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect.	3.2913473316685025
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be.	1.8352295095093605
Compare it with what happens in December.	1.4695566461679743
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks.	2.9647521530757515
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level.	2.0610637365748166
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers ' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	1.9930562449865046
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	2.5691127021984737
The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas?	2.00615555256258
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up.	2.60245432200617
- (PT) Mrs Korhola, as you will understand, I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply.	2.6835609072294972
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years.	2.469803115822581
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.	2.3315234833804417
Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups.	2.090367454702047
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.	2.520221359599065
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	2.41542075513481
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	1.8190969997407525
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	2.076374170020357
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.	2.2962544073219213
As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit.	1.9402098451394816
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	2.283390028882342
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	2.626692020909605
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this.	2.192442773899878
The documents will in the main be open working documents.	2.769569996489461
In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou ' s proposals.	2.607493157853701
First of all, civil society.	1.6889345746823905
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress.	1.8165235735183767
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.	2.306749353310934
A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture.	2.306774396963541
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.	2.9940536640788973
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria.	1.5240972188299213
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary.	2.177736855752147
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses.	2.5395369638467074
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	2.5457728721154824
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.	2.0319316112216734
As I said at the beginning, the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed.	2.6094698760156474
Because they have a different level of education.	2.0371694620373484
What concrete measures have been discussed?	2.590113420950008
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	2.276666957293633
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	2.5458900369635864
NATO is largely European.	1.3808965939329128
The Commission ' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence.	2.5070287548763166
It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way.	2.354848482924039
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	1.8389261676018522
If we are to strengthen the European Union ' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action.	2.54855081694504
I hope for their adoption.	3.3468540162083342
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon.	2.2787704634537884
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	1.3938537295111153
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission	1.674185752662575
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.	2.2642116343400045
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	2.6937681150432002
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.	2.5924596436753613
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.	2.725932299109656
So the "Grappa War" is over.	1.9432887326689614
Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.	1.8015276114238559
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	2.3817616447416525
That is my first question.	2.7527010684804716
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice.	2.530946747895122
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC.	2.68256713171086
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	1.7644616645098457
At my hearing last September, I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper.	1.8196557776653934
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	2.783768223397464
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.	1.902108381537786
However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.	2.7583795022563216
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	2.4311750567018082
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	2.033495982517417
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular.	2.5340666251530184
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of.	2.852312556593076
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.	2.4737129350676827
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	1.9619298447752516
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):	1.8113994555562247
The postal service is also the social service.	3.050225674595144
If you ratify this development, then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union.	2.54349374652389
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	3.009261875677998
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	2.589629346723974
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?	1.6175198209481076
This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.	2.1075219597997648
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.	2.3177940137811603
Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer.	2.6719562147783944
So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.	2.2421410421139174
The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules.	2.5661233098045644
The environment is in a parlous state.	3.2235418659422215
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.	2.49172854183993
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.	1.352731317238696
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.	1.915963461788658
We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year.	1.9014191526846826
We are to get the documents that are sent to them.	2.5502849656466995
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today.	3.913122325450038
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	2.97743594192517
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.	2.7083615286058147
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	2.1843782174783013
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted.	2.6757076318574855
Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this?	2.078999831436869
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	1.964772089378856
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation.	2.979511381375644
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.	2.634196323082981
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances.	1.8029661272504311
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.	2.7492966647973853
It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP ' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.	2.0759149541734514
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro	2.088660476187212
Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission.	3.3887479683958333
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.	2.1506905906443348
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.	2.3287926815010387
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	2.2083481045186235
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	3.0068628504069745
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.	2.8162446028196575
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.	2.7378916173133585
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	2.363014318076975
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	1.864973936098386
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	2.799206065627038
You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.	2.098077831509918
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	2.636064071333849
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	1.9450487167926704
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong.	1.887859623212336
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	2.4864111583141524
Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations.	2.664174857667139
We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe ' s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.	2.7690997861278075
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	2.341526891586382
(The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.4508850366397787
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	2.2451452414348454
At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto.	2.080904089461058
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	2.326156259227244
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.	2.569034553971539
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union ' s status in the world.	2.328326740296863
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.	1.947808961619363
What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat.	2.0218402741905273
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	2.615679661600142
The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself.	1.99221127436304
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance.	3.033380973711887
This is the crux of the matter.	2.067553899487666
If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake.	2.1051466845315177
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol.	2.4682518375644436
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	2.465367161179932
What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?	1.7427429757933621
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.	2.515058986705881
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.	2.223469208704465
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.	2.1121209625127304
In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results.	2.2735586574083557
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	2.360948563185262
The plant is not yet there.	3.732658795154347
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal.	2.1362657228726425
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	2.9084636538959594
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.	2.24052834444766
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.	2.0127191178525745
Our own staff policy is outdated.	2.1779148547030287
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47.	2.7151279864563467
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999.	1.911745537270827
Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy.	2.3603978045270146
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	2.550433565678653
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	2.724670946844447
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	2.4335235603383705
This is true, if we think of Russia ' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	2.382353178006887
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.	2.8845130422475544
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	2.8700894580005607
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	2.432705521357824
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.	2.6629689186205314
I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market.	2.2058864164202494
As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	2.420878583088691
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.	2.826237601390028
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress.	2.304722142154086
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.	2.5543827239186063
	1.0510108151299706
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	2.252398386500054
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union.	3.056409822231309
Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands.	2.306267647394646
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok ' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	2.0539357209388784
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.	2.7099608510329403
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	1.552914149387876
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion.	1.9366443060467562
What guarantees are there of its reliability?	2.2973328525587884
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	2.030278024081089
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises. What we have here, first and foremost, is an incredibly ominous mixture of power, arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union.	2.475498903420914
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	2.2517868041109876
Quality products in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies.	2.457891903505434
Mr President, it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission, and I will refer to this later on.	3.2756175185553786
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems.	2.444410819427276
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.	2.005599459726844
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.	2.144525640634879
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.	1.880672244490673
Mr Rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.	3.6648668192322247
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU ' s Barcelona process.	2.272189654600597
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	2.1387345439005774
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.	2.3350205692293597
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	2.352335569509296
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?	1.7018790853937156
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	2.2060611258395393
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects.	2.0744082152059953
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption.	2.1758718153861967
In the Sunday papers all over Greece: the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund: the Minister ' s work; the Ministry of Agriculture: the Minister ' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications: the work of the Minister for Telecommunications; the Ministry of Education: the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister; the Ministry of Employment: the work of the Minister for Employment, a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary, and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework.	1.9993737326813459
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	2.0581376977453747
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	1.9103754506785455
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up.	2.425205536083918
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	1.917324921456663
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.	1.7470356096387847
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has.	3.5973958840830287
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up.	2.3821437906084606
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.	2.429996357157001
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.	2.139109217388552
Unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers, we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity, as Vaclav Havel said here today, and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity.	2.0694233680495167
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues ' instincts are naturally aroused.	1.9391808757464764
The fabric of Turkey ' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.	2.7207331705082582
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.	2.1648291824722676
With regard to Parliament 's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.	2.039297001726101
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us.	2.6761883311958807
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future.	2.2133545350095654
Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000)	1.4040693901739092
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	2.0582207597409816
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	2.5993225739886
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	2.343364926903738
Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.	2.0451498549145914
If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.	2.2570089759009146
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	2.215618241951429
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery.	1.926181153715
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	2.486779510211825
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.	2.27030187879382
After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.	1.8337917871088707
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.	2.1367565853011485
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint.	2.5737349090046586
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	2.224662003218159
In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water.	2.3650426134352536
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services.	2.396274634273509
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.	1.7302487143793954
With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	2.1872441144947485
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself.	2.1783380655783304
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.	2.2927312110488582
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	2.15476256340751
If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective.	2.2754684178728586
Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured.	1.7161940699123706
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?	1.8246726872077328
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	2.531676803595312
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	1.9504907810200107
It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.	1.9120610015663497
(Limited applause)	1.2503757742179755
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked.	2.73694249079353
The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000.	2.571492001113415
This is also at the request of the citizens.	2.5520941531915495
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.	2.0756035657669907
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	2.163148734295759
It also inspires a few political comments.	2.686324919090318
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	2.0700646979190025
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	1.499351369599418
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission ' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them.	3.1902666151439965
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	2.2396957772619612
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.	2.2454309323933486
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy.	2.4677080009615615
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284.	1.9690441731955353
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate.	2.120713893846628
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union.	2.3049033547332454
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	3.2590457041869163
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.	2.4141176796730632
It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced.	2.252138819027568
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.	2.5713449262714936
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.	1.743785519068549
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.	2.2114271577070466
. (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.	2.2389060319771796
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	1.9708591761206529
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	2.8794525306188783
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market.	2.1626619832673715
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	2.107110293970072
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	1.8180114900105677
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	2.325624851545722
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	2.4444457557223735
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication.	2.4326916266592598
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms.	1.7468917331033385
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	2.3830088368437594
We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious.	2.312874575035717
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	2.7679054445222486
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.	2.956563526974241
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	2.6348480175433853
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	1.7190533490193975
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party ' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	2.046613537539352
I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85.	2.2579998291022365
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	1.6049286260990823
The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy.	2.184502064111932
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission ' s opinion.	2.783940127034095
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	2.840526448974226
From this point of view, the common position is weak.	2.5522631766906425
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	2.0114668053512696
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.	1.7819032028717978
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	2.21431771791699
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?	2.044174783197502
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.	2.8590467988097874
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	2.2200222281203357
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.	1.6313715822508161
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries.	2.3630858320218473
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.	1.7606957931135947
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.	2.9045248204269494
In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency.	1.9792762830201742
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	2.1523017512157088
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS.	1.897172377562394
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	2.707603118762528
It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are.	2.440801602458967
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	2.4975932043521354
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	1.8424852558880205
Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail.	2.294490525678181
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved.	2.5124509160397452
.	1.374839594702952
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.	3.0520435764157425
Mr President, today ' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.	2.4420195721526348
It is good that the procedure exists.	2.626834795318033
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term.	2.0481425906920365
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	2.28597646945508
Mr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday.	1.9583736631783208
Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time.	1.7674693333970437
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	2.693111868250083
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved.	2.2211001008774836
You can be satisfied with the progress made.	2.3407168826850566
We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.	1.9588545693789876
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	2.5163157455184924
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.	1.7502464249547658
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe.	2.1215460043765995
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.	1.5546296261742365
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows.	2.143348950657306
The damage to your country, Mr President, and to mine, Spain, could be horrendous.	2.4998686522731584
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people ' s rights to privacy.	2.7722112618235624
Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	2.488727505291174
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns.	2.644322107238576
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue.	2.025376924491959
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	2.4325055459632905
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death.	1.8999184952283346
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	2.596383198899933
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	1.7377626323428246
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.	1.811829187393893
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.	2.4059335869709333
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	1.5814473175346566
Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction.	1.903785699990714
I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council.	2.6561751020138398
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	2.1979496323359977
On this we are clear.	2.504469614104233
Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions.	2.497886368698966
We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.	2.3958075160327743
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.	2.187238720008587
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds.	2.3215355788406984
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation.	2.272101511587195
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	2.2322267132812246
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.	2.6904340557493516
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.	2.2931848090940843
The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years.	2.267593890176452
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.	2.541566043454249
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service.	1.6351414312745896
However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them.	1.986941905303264
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	1.83083188121007
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	2.5522157139027106
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	2.1140795742836636
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.	2.0258974339881264
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers ' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory '.	1.8238307639967641
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.	1.9986797294982621
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	2.6296382896378905
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	1.92369421824405
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks.	2.5047798180097662
Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species.	1.8447021892577553
This requires internal stability.	3.2086721068103268
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.	2.517624164604223
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection.	2.0720208126888213
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.	1.8893547743226107
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.	2.3963019300105852
This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening.	2.767963510505838
Furthermore, he considers that "genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document, official or otherwise, which is affixed to or accompanies the additive" .	1.6201204124968094
It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries.	2.1543283385544534
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	2.537973039149119
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	1.448530518720445
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	2.6603902748135657
Report (A5-0003/2000) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on	1.8745791343372908
Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann ' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur ' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity.	2.3911122642034988
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift.	2.878603785885838
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.	2.115172073785948
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.	2.109834723898839
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	1.4189566192504857
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	2.3642299738706685
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.	1.896599624356038
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	2.6239700913688795
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	2.336036870947283
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	2.683420615832351
However, I should like to stress INTERREG ' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	2.183280699547582
In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states.	2.5460121705339795
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	2.5357631556152684
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports.	2.9265856743744605
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	1.808615435441002
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.	1.9282559901148018
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease.	2.841813315043279
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People ' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable.	1.69222399820502
This was an important consideration for us.	2.7464624057515934
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers.	2.179422215293547
Such transactions, according to the argument, bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables. This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir.	1.9354150310470237
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.	2.3940848331948597
It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution.	2.846959373533353
The purpose of the Commission 's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists.	3.682877749567527
I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke ' s speech in particular, in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union.	2.503099767235254
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	1.944589651330522
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	2.4210073934061804
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	1.976387423136052
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.	2.77951791815972
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU ' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.	2.456231965498915
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	1.7927176836281964
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?	1.8426455241467097
I also welcome the Commission 's communication.	3.8409860250186787
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation.	1.8470393013758937
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.	1.6656764865527742
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	2.5638856504991483
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	2.5496822190513555
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	2.8832865097419824
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	2.770657136374581
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union ' s dependence on imported energy.	2.473861912860937
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube ' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	2.3866196815358736
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	1.967786448177938
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.	2.4174901737805934
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction.	2.485854852738839
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	1.4978111935771363
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.591476154890115
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	2.3958330459505714
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality.	2.142343070909057
We are discussing last year ' s discharge, but also the Commission ' s responsibility.	3.1870315738118498
Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union.	1.6572630385237068
Thank you, Mr President.	1.9836498923912413
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	2.5558651337140725
For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law.	1.7258884496781965
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved.	2.156074798910333
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.	3.2457701366026597
Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries.	2.3590694716393394
Within these regions, a huge range of problems have their part to play.	1.6679722810272266
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	2.280295124455952
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.	2.9613035867004784
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights.	2.6622136742614444
We must put an end to this.	2.8452391140809192
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	1.883608236881539
Apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the Community market, what we term 'development aid ' to the ACP has fallen constantly, from 70% of total European Union aid in 1986 to 30% in 1998.	1.7268876418895254
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	3.4195129352365505
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	1.8881981137592343
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.	2.7410240555917524
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders.	2.2164887865358214
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424.	2.8556024240448616
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.	2.1420192330047882
This model function also applies to regional cooperation.	2.8225413745610965
The Union ' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	2.3961174896466146
Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies.	1.6806120824859967
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.	3.804952827056268
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	2.731711974169373
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	2.6891844885827245
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report.	1.9164331206203853
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.	2.099469128800645
The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.	2.6228671523992206
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.	2.565058294404996
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ.	2.327225531299996
We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen.	2.2545790956165606
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.	2.0571303363621003
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.	2.1511257363281238
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.	3.827898931412302
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	2.720859103267432
This is an irreparable loss.	2.732602334091538
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.	2.1706434768420793
As things are at present, the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel 's water supply.	1.949483484309041
However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints.	2.4217558169044073
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.	2.496883650654969
So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either.	1.8775586104107396
There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies.	2.1234856464893097
Over the past couple of years, a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and, more especially, the Lomé countries.	2.134001326957011
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	3.0108752091153392
This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe.	2.361860106096939
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?	2.3162100681831195
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.	2.199592977687132
We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote.	2.5489656521241915
Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area.	2.203356223799569
Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria	2.3566700074499365
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed.	1.9530194356855066
Does that give me hope for the year 2000?	2.132838521457116
. (FR) We are disappointed by the Council ' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive.	3.049314525224048
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM ' s relations with all its neighbours.	2.1328232927832502
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	3.071851429457462
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.	2.089120531143557
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	2.4996965627865246
What is left, for example, of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny, if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently by you in Portugal, Mr President of the Council.	1.8893775737820357
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.	2.285204237042899
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	2.4325503278526
In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today.	3.044599657120663
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.	1.9653582394999565
Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.	1.9265392566051407
When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.	1.862510343248536
Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce.	2.564992188509154
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	1.9158678398701023
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	2.252331651841124
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	2.0330979783859453
We all have, as it were, our histories to live with, but it is important that business has legal certainty.	2.4137058191900036
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	1.8799725652238841
This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done.	1.8527726887024152
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.	2.4632742342272675
The European Union ' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	2.1536431531056257
This is the European Union ' s declared aim.	3.598209635845178
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	1.838013121105461
Quite, we agree absolutely.	1.561479589928501
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6008080479545364
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.	2.1498713280109203
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.	2.776258233501211
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently.	3.0435987228959838
The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter ' s prior authorisation.	2.135486955656132
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.	2.1168299162342716
Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.	2.162131897697423
At the moment, the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem.	2.154362938216724
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	1.7742546483276767
In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.	2.945212044108303
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.	1.8602615142582732
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.	2.2354747286002223
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.	3.098809179083819
You say there will be no further funding.	2.806899040479145
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.	2.0062290795001174
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.	3.33198150418258
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	1.6977402755275692
A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.	1.6357360993847467
However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire.	3.152163236785554
The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity.	2.422308692251313
I would just make one point: we cannot be 100% sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus.	2.098706806601905
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	2.2501340022385654
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	2.2913093180531887
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	2.167594865487861
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union ' s ability to match words with action.	2.2001648003558394
So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation.	2.8362275101028707
We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process.	2.5770749867802656
Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies.	2.094938407573638
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	3.150016593542752
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial, because otherwise there can be no development. It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique ' s debts.	1.8045549502227178
First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction?	2.058106279241053
Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.	2.093103238926638
The principle of 'polluter pays ' is not being applied.	2.4826165303303953
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.	2.2667954398881567
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.	2.1236092544187986
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	1.6848852037200877
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	2.7444842247375063
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	2.0503022984567036
The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed.	2.2401649733610176
Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa ' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures.	2.020489552206777
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.	2.397806308753771
With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.	2.3315719286504044
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	1.8712923137399688
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	2.51656015628749
We should get it into perspective.	2.917736844443673
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles (8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD) (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	1.815202699534516
This is not impossible.	3.112296282418156
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.	2.92201802614763
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	2.574472652369804
Let the managers manage.	2.3342429671436657
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted.	1.9277918142254646
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	2.2263946942748585
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	2.504327163874321
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	1.9159672717518963
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars.	2.03354949803806
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.	2.4741492755410905
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.	2.0274465987586634
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States.	2.1023106637359783
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one.	2.2735222868912164
Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union.	2.640768796232635
Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen.	2.443949853323937
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.	2.416713781023462
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions.	2.883341100191267
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	2.5292978688983943
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.	2.755681129958263
For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU ' s institutions respond to our citizens ' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection.	2.1084011075293723
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.	2.5768193834285325
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.	2.6347969801371254
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe ' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.	2.4729913548249653
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.	2.1197992674639687
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	1.9134457128409077
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.	2.2227259389765943
Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too.	2.0520664450495354
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future.	2.3642850804221074
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin.	2.6531094264600923
This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.	2.2140197051322352
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens ' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	2.5520639512099765
The Food Safety Authority 's situation is quite different.	2.715029264843272
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.	1.925771481520661
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading.	2.4210904872107895
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.	2.6635409767214355
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe ' s most highly-developed regions.	2.218720134111716
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission.	1.9796416749973509
In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.	2.065417432205073
There is time.	2.8793014319373844
The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises.	2.424607676629714
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.020797597978323
In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences!	1.8692270691842834
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors.	2.0898165186600126
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets.	3.316710779951165
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	2.4374618618372983
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	2.531439676524844
In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency.	2.1592996876911923
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.	2.6806840552771485
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission ' s social programme.	2.7070864784414805
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	3.4530227380894813
If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more.	2.8261958052060288
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.	2.3140873483873237
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	1.9348435424011865
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company.	2.1851272613473847
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission ' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	2.640967255901859
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	2.086652218243595
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.	2.5608687644735086
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.	2.463771551158614
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .	1.9571419532934113
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	1.4893692053134873
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak.	2.9162863389709632
Therefore, if the regulation is adopted, the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will be made using the new system.	1.8712177502789884
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies.	2.2867017604216726
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance.	2.4762565933824083
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.	1.7553161914477602
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union ' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	2.2626943059345006
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media.	2.014026895327696
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	1.895233536192735
. (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists.	2.6220045616045593
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts.	2.7108546503658695
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	2.072549083578087
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work.	3.696544044199117
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	2.929311168830031
Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.	2.3363851138467435
I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system.	2.0845766788807545
Thank you, Minister.	2.3513055189505496
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security.	1.9691177396498212
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	2.159310136761294
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.	2.990267705738267
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	2.1721843278335586
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.	1.945458038704593
Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years.	1.992362225662989
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	2.0437224930354736
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	2.378961940471722
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time.	3.1831131061873257
Such is life.	2.135880914587902
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	2.6986757950345237
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe.	2.3599242786171475
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	1.7802157099811473
Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say.	2.034623003706661
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation, the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster.	2.2951768099707075
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	2.1847131109232927
We are badly behind now in this matter.	2.3621034112264883
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	2.1991858667829653
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month.	2.6171150010108297
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.	2.3180961206737933
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that.	2.4284473499245984
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark.	2.3065022309529515
However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive.	2.744740929853351
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	2.342970289205411
However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries.	2.3202926296602366
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	2.7005311152091402
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.	2.0352798817430706
As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task.	2.658324615279936
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	2.6252333149605267
These are what are missing.	2.4020631144931257
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	2.749115696507157
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges.	3.1176712177040216
I have explained the position of the Commission.	2.9632247518058206
Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	2.0808321355597252
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present.	2.3544727910152607
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter.	3.6520196836007983
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	2.1867954151321025
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria ' s financial record.	2.4865213244763478
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.	2.1128273636983423
Moreover, the concept of 'author ' is not defined in the Treaties.	2.094285197269125
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	2.164014733390768
We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee.	2.151475710014787
Like the work on employment, the Commission ' s proposal is founded upon four pillars.	2.3228184810127837
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.	2.656734821135234
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	1.9091971712958962
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.	2.2140729447805647
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people.	2.5569949180720615
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	2.0052274794720497
The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come.	1.8720862549132196
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.	2.3885836217553567
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?	1.8420233509626949
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.	2.2555390139488964
I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.	2.4356237259570883
Firstly, the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed.	2.20009916238115
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	2.237938304727246
and	1.3731465988407632
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States.	2.569655796347755
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	2.2820163501078614
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.	2.0076944118585915
Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development.	1.6177225110231035
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.	2.3096881148345783
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	2.1857166325916015
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	2.402080402743411
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	2.580830161980059
I do hope that this will not be necessary.	4.082390891234713
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement.	2.5191510540318522
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	2.3380752281541706
Mr Bösch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them.	2.330884404835081
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management.	2.2105274388186813
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.	2.3114495075994195
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	2.0023684997053035
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment.	2.091014005934231
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.	2.298775975047552
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	3.230788580481439
If you are persuasive in your actions, we all reap the benefits.	1.9315154081878942
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)	1.5540944303769562
I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted.	2.4260193849947305
Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power.	1.81936977196642
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.	2.0813348555592373
The Commission is following with very great concern, as I know all honourable Members will be, the emergency situation in Mozambique.	2.0571016783478444
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so?	2.075560974961162
It turned its threatened loss of power into an "heroic battle for the preservation of values" and an imminent, pure-and-simple "decision between democracy and non-democracy" .	1.7811185639152376
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	2.1696804282307034
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	1.6999110545545073
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.	1.6271599667836238
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	2.547061228877669
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	2.1216739371919515
Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments.	1.8527253293929964
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.	2.147354951001887
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU ' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex.	2.609960898648769
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	3.6136026926804363
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.	2.6314451079475716
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done.	2.3776960825689466
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	2.9920070754325234
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.	2.192301176859227
This is not an option for us any more.	2.6327363762151337
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action.	2.3192063785215287
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.	2.3337044383461705
Mr Rübig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well.	2.544167604147513
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	1.8960070407022296
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	2.0613651226819796
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.	3.0952409648642103
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	2.3588305012586916
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.	1.584322569858352
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	2.7589615545471697
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.	3.5492932515996927
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	2.0888355967464896
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid.	1.9373953631877627
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.	2.1167815129960945
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal ' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion.	2.5943371527769368
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves.	2.4156313030430527
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.	1.928144570175303
We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure.	2.324606304628052
I must say that Alex Langer 's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved.	2.376346529129907
These are serious allegations.	2.4426633522843217
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	1.7244868289254613
In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis?	2.37894860686789
We have achieved a compromise solution.	2.9745075669514405
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks.	1.7956117740848296
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	1.8978004834039197
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	2.4479478837716706
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	2.0238133766799282
I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs.	2.1768611476693716
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.	2.5354351377879665
Parliament ' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive ' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.	1.9781738098536548
However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.	1.9324753946134094
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review ' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].	1.9452782707963665
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.	2.140158549531193
According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds.	1.98315342579616
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.	2.549594384352101
I suppose that the first thing they say will be, 'let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union ' .	2.7582526306108606
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation.	1.615638619869537
Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.	1.8927020676752244
Whose turn is next?	1.3870764274688971
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	2.905488635770703
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	3.2427557316439084
The European Commission ' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	2.527567167648317
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.	2.7487091917964044
In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner ' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres.	2.5232062588508417
This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States.	3.1867372628249875
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard.	2.409415934787466
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	2.6056434081765993
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden, they are calling for more bureaucracy, for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary ' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee, contrary to several resolutions by Parliament.	1.963779806865185
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	1.8945141302249677
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people.	2.8750182364166634
It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.	2.255928751037317
Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.	2.3888309943970407
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.	2.677041946696623
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today.	3.2651937627360863
We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds.	3.05125457083795
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent?	1.8916732744579303
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection.	2.127808214150431
However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.	2.390974573729807
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	2.599517583437151
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	2.3936496444338378
But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse.	1.8435887361422785
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?	2.007837955490288
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.	1.4977004084331031
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.	2.5056515157566133
Indeed, it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international, public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by.	1.7637940628405624
. (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council.	2.3948094469496457
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.	2.1503838656966767
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments.	1.8350795267788444
Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us.	2.3245500086543247
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.	3.0142732836498904
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.	1.9065617251359643
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.	2.249882484297715
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	2.374764690058273
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	2.2518284958852552
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.	2.1593999796359036
What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect?	2.273869366644488
I can gauge its importance for my country ' s international reputation.	2.589623481268845
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.	2.436978839088525
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.	2.43339389864281
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.	2.9441086062205652
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	2.339518419032697
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights.	2.848676340878745
We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable.	2.5514351334782286
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.	3.747156077851619
Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation:	1.9873370829306567
As for a ban on certain materials: of course we need one!	2.4479502620810107
However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	2.351127505792713
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.	2.5057721079959068
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.	1.9748654065260953
The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought.	2.2090097856334205
There is no other such policy.	2.3182522625217064
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	2.897720885007795
Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	2.0841057037990782
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory?	1.9320142903467643
This will therefore be our rule.	3.4136252279568247
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.4511410500885278
We have seen vote after vote lost.	2.563747522672152
I would ask him to be brief.	3.004132670515562
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	2.7083054983481047
Secondly, speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify.	2.2189015794692732
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.	2.644865707727213
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.	1.6588074083884998
And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow.	1.8508959511676957
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.	1.8951331924394634
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.	2.811957261387122
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction?	2.1922591024443894
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	2.3883050319233914
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	2.7010875692755887
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.	2.6765741867806514
However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	2.0262913627637484
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.	2.1194133271528774
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy.	2.8081211670475774
Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.	1.7069234045168498
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	1.7498400751245158
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	1.8259815257222374
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	2.0632591330377212
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	2.8851696221618743
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States.	2.241767242114153
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit.	2.8037141450056815
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	2.5011651052381274
Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded.	2.690489792189653
Report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 - 'Comitology ' (1999/468/EC)	2.2758314917199636
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	2.573868364589354
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.	1.7899920988941362
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	3.240380445945603
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions.	2.5928262693488557
Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France ' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay.	1.7206627024212402
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances.	1.920938133773829
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references.	2.3178957370187625
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	2.2650780804444284
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	2.255037235263079
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area.	2.220247220386728
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety.	2.252439866377175
We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.	2.9126679699132914
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	1.846620505245787
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.935748292827478
Mr Alavanos, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised.	2.842070567329535
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.	2.3381185489350007
However, the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned.	2.4229472669401373
We have to get this right.	2.9117522173058075
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	2.1274088038793777
Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities.	1.9585675284047088
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.	2.5815006237488376
The cultural programmes launched in years past - Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael - are being replaced by a single programme, Culture 2000, where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor.	2.1466388651006523
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny.	2.651644077893008
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.	2.408183103373082
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.	3.0348409837732815
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.	1.669908890161762
It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London.	1.8481123376177169
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.	2.023633579167606
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union.	2.1340199653811784
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.	1.9926184260837103
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present.	2.0900003750420617
Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income.	3.0010781541361755
This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings.	2.378267884131672
I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic ' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair.	2.0258369102233043
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	2.10208852605878
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000.	2.2959919919116856
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane.	1.7373404624843503
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	2.310775472351571
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues.	2.702283641038875
Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets.	2.1769315294973106
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	2.484265367589241
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.	2.0084397651445696
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.	2.6103382548216163
A legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the Structural Funds, as was the case in the past, to obtain some loose change.	2.1378616081686794
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	3.0257042956616997
In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters.	2.0495030307705284
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.	2.513397693041327
The main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings, for example units in funds, standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments.	2.0492693578879346
The challenge was immense.	3.7181796606223636
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.	2.1729036987626453
In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified.	1.9636499279455695
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.	2.1811470328473517
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	2.8890792967680086
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals.	2.017751734752649
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same.	1.8160695847279318
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	2.5071589921402264
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union ' s enlargement.	3.105442706230538
Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic.	1.4871731679466715
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial.	1.9581364948588444
Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.	1.7914437534343746
Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer.	2.146220833656562
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.	2.010828219062962
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	1.6172054608863995
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium?	1.759193003991679
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises.	2.077772327950359
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.	3.4694445791285835
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	2.2638370958525993
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.	3.90872668133526
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold.	2.122538389738192
They are already having implications for resource availability.	2.105634690202404
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	2.300075901427144
They are very important in this case.	2.6148149651924903
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	2.349689998893609
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.	2.571851346148445
Common fisheries policy	1.3950843734482226
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	2.1776816002656405
As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate.	1.828911646366225
It could have sunk anywhere.	3.0137316713084057
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	1.614532898222942
Are there any comments?	1.2644728256185398
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	2.74909316314216
Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.	2.1347265407439044
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	1.9058945378045835
You are expected to ask questions, not necessarily make lengthy statements.	1.98008370412054
Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped.	2.364018781159599
Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.	3.4790372651419674
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood ' s remark.	2.2869365927778573
What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast?	2.2323205296717603
I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	2.6596210334292594
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica.	2.0283135087225777
The credit for Mozambique ' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique.	2.1539610844312937
It is downright scandalous what goes on!	2.378193814533162
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem.	2.396128465172387
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.	2.5465020735373516
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not.	2.3600017003451312
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again.	2.488477702473476
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures.	2.9937285047800017
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however.	1.8893273797498726
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	1.982141827666098
. (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE.	2.9309202076880356
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	2.766368544134649
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	2.106583969781731
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	1.7974990220132951
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	2.6495740899572904
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Radicals; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberals and Austrian liberals.	1.9955949951889027
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2183945468114763
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!	1.7407031059684788
.	1.374839594702952
I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	2.2440973714622077
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	2.8242295540598024
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change.	2.221405027069128
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome.	2.6253454573934527
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	2.3881871182650762
One of the programme 's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility.	2.058552375896447
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.	1.9286978392067666
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report, which, although geared more towards a specific sector, is a valuable contribution.	2.1396585788320124
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.	2.439318245922655
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this.	2.040483180580348
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.	2.3553983750844547
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	2.7598957283161947
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990.	2.412626032599374
Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together.	3.207951811618622
The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it.	2.2006963206061987
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)	1.5572728363254145
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	2.155047671129448
Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia.	2.8468125237509554
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.	2.826106423268728
This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs ' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.	2.288222019808068
Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another.	1.5418987087649905
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency.	2.6502301260370973
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.	2.2150832689835642
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.	2.661359135786198
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.	2.009669604889403
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	1.9520842437995034
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union.	2.5515567934198744
No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses.	1.9349749371800502
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	3.3296267580203756
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	2.9450554393744355
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	2.0419540243618375
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	2.589541947428872
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.	1.8183809438571126
First, and the Commissioner has also confirmed this, because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets.	2.092475298659405
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	2.5319545114893343
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	2.329821308780328
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council ' s position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible.	2.444521260147694
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	2.709319592018287
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.	2.4573472088884487
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.	2.3380362401028334
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission ' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];	1.8779769046773231
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	2.9847120208274185
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	2.2592590290785086
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.	2.5764361076520284
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.	2.004721030318293
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.	2.158727188472529
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	2.490131122811991
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	2.6446921041621643
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	3.0523954628545535
They will need time to get used to that too.	2.1390269721266195
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.	2.295773165239196
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	2.081341478079527
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.	1.8433649535769077
Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.	2.3012515738675874
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union.	2.1913641832304154
In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk.	1.944863976132264
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship.	2.1404171048967036
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one ' s office at European level.	2.0765327167189103
Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe ' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%?	1.9794149254957958
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.	2.8776877339638416
In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy?	3.388904462677381
Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be.	1.6752650203105344
Because it is political it is more complex.	1.8319634926472705
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason.	1.9265137085507376
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN).	2.3885784336118956
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today, with this debate and this motion, this question is now on the agenda of European construction.	2.492047098010337
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government ' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	1.6030922316279996
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	2.1387407995626235
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner ' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia ' s problems, but more particularly Serbia ' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	2.0726335829522275
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	2.047116517365285
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	2.1400628318157073
We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead.	1.9910629737626795
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	2.5956229791721377
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.	2.4529318628180024
If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either.	1.8616709447073025
I also reject this line of argument.	2.8804152761179265
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures.	1.9488175621199288
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment, as well as the transfer of territories.	2.9194555609887662
. Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report.	2.459400012524382
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign.	3.161132690941347
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).	2.199499996279139
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.	1.8504522280066438
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	2.1020162687394714
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.	2.478619260385884
Read Mr Katiforis ' s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment.	1.693301225574042
It naturally has to support these negotiations, sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency, within the powers of the European Union, is positive.	2.5281324200271125
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee)	2.2714902969004593
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.	2.658968511303022
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	2.2705079360689155
For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars.	2.240840076798664
All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.	2.158115542007111
We all took part in it, not just one group.	2.7825311210235015
Which is why the new 20-year agreement due to be signed in Fiji on 31 May represents more than the simple renewal of the Conventions regulating relations between Europe and the ACP.	1.9251160590047443
In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.	2.171569303095364
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.	2.4363955990608437
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.	1.888499485246097
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.	3.190876858045663
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	2.559984449050239
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate.	2.5790363245877406
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.	1.7829032503827442
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.	3.510506266136094
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment.	2.378651872011855
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	3.008125680863907
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	2.4609998361684435
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	2.4508582884021908
However, the appointment was cancelled at the last minute.	2.4595211208406296
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe.	2.660961741313946
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands.	3.0753330789711018
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective.	2.9327592533892273
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.	1.531871103762308
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	2.06263827183769
Madam President, I would like to comment on the Florenz report.	2.2865472375698332
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."	1.7937678805607389
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	2.2085921133155253
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos.	1.9185912078322716
This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more.	1.7842731461749803
I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening.	2.1538445909346726
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.	2.5744854220899467
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	2.368883263559272
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	2.1954755356545714
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	2.294002749816624
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	2.004774255932713
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.	2.6289046989605165
I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so.	2.567482547531916
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.	3.456662209256722
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson ' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission 's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	2.115199892062095
Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects.	2.1100877323393017
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together.	1.8912149149143405
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk.	2.5411244104239206
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.	2.4341222850354782
We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.	2.90678722769859
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.	2.2123522825144564
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved.	2.1755186736763656
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case.	2.1551869960550523
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica.	2.0146401309785475
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen.	2.81094644483636
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	2.429788314954918
Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs.	2.2233036188684134
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.	1.9723119873900856
Mr President, there is a mystery.	3.38018795763234
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.	1.881348726194378
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years ' time about the future of the policy.	2.672163005905223
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	3.4310368167214045
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.	2.405160613331947
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	2.2839765899912705
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	2.1688280422390593
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.	4.7689584976987
The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights.	2.2384144819250835
Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.	2.324909372321679
One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions.	2.331167274276595
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	1.2511519164288027
We already have an infrastructure.	3.065172629758165
Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.	1.968355456853698
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	1.8763283571702776
Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives.	1.5129428343798257
I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water.	2.4444236882296413
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	1.9907616136848467
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it.	2.302907409302846
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report.	2.5103182453263817
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them.	2.839850140604656
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary.	2.786612044459287
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	2.2154996078389626
Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague 's Bavarian beer?	1.6456442462725385
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy ' s effectiveness which must therefore, in my opinion, be significantly improved.	2.5548955055929645
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0125/2000) by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the UN Commission on human rights	1.9523757000882425
However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission ' s staff is very low.	2.8570504192800223
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing.	1.8166031414265411
And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.	2.330356930896166
The EU Presidency ' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.	2.4537277821150583
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union ' s fundamental objectives.	3.817678313569979
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	2.5887840338084493
You have not integrated it anywhere.	2.078888536502487
We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.	2.967763183953161
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	2.452535306288086
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	2.4623261987187077
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	2.0545049004240985
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	2.3572437669826303
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?	2.2780726822292867
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.	2.970800423521579
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	2.8804197882503084
But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers.	1.775077840486518
It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.	2.2513954415349446
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	2.402576254476614
It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries, but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge.	2.723415176466105
There is nothing new in your work programme.	2.1626867255359468
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police.	1.679806483861346
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.	2.723362719937568
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.	3.0935166495067836
I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	1.8417853148953385
Its argument was one of priority.	1.9602427429626188
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.	2.1464207443596663
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	1.9913863231083921
Over 95% of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world.	1.8770928940267633
By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations.	2.136264366531802
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women ' s voices.	3.002331976196654
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	2.1056766323038416
Is this not a contradiction?	2.2153843826047472
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.057599999964031
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.	1.7588254406382304
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
We understand the context of this essential debate.	3.6615620233840382
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	2.2123884137085588
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	2.1754702055785473
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	1.7267491697155266
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	2.0433560665147925
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners	1.8515084056182085
That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action.	2.1781219346540004
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	2.5775784324534925
From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean.	2.1106914604400293
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	1.980943362605874
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission ' s way of working.	2.343480546695494
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.	2.5429830771554967
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union.	2.3114485541087784
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.	2.15160132136664
the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)].	1.7034660257170562
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness.	2.8362672425700515
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.	2.7796050289231617
Third, there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment.	1.7838163476246134
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	2.9099435653618997
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union ' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment.	2.35765066182734
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	2.856713897760253
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.	1.5221853562334684
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
This is a true example of the Council ' s indifference towards culture, despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance.	2.771158448541859
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	2.977704449295768
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.	2.2375867328268217
The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme.	2.6696359490400936
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	2.3202795003891667
The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice.	2.073627834680559
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before. We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions.	2.363256031792588
It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda.	2.215114283996223
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this.	2.1539905735586604
As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives.	2.623170010096756
I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now.	2.4416046371296845
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	2.6456485990318677
A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing.	3.0025575147432333
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.	2.71835965705655
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission 's administration with the public.	3.3638031454275503
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	2.7784707980614822
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.	3.07519235104397
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums.	2.2041266380472915
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.	2.6289433453588695
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval.	2.751249477715493
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork.	2.1182253769151798
That is not correct.	2.4638592761223665
I utterly reject this!	3.64379031653656
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	2.779306519684177
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House ' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique. I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available.	2.536769963063664
I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement.	2.3979952340226047
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.	2.107886332086118
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union ' s role in international development policies is significant.	2.88003149693742
The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way, but without forgetting public investment.	2.576692887457844
But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough.	2.424879899853987
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.	1.9401043024599898
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.	1.4841282739752344
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.	2.787898939848653
I would urge Parliament to support them.	3.287233082766654
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	2.333357357913138
This discussion is not new.	3.0418141054477004
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House.	2.81058839900151
Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources.	1.9676151410095923
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	1.9141351275899747
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.	2.1303481794267687
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	2.3372069027673392
The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament ' s in-house service?	2.050331157511792
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro.	2.2380829833638414
It is important to remember that.	2.8413185162653343
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations.	2.7421905623773717
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.	2.2123750154661805
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	2.176087739107709
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier ' of the Union.	2.382689807933386
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others.	1.3602132747624744
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	2.7773220514360952
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato ' s report receives more support.	2.794149503183355
Genuine transparency of the institutions ' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	2.49703694475265
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	2.342788249841492
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell.	2.1913447073159515
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	3.0970114476446007
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose.	2.5684793615922237
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	2.4305985098171456
Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important.	2.5256778485984026
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.	1.9030818920380594
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident.	1.4482047151558826
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	2.5075831301623666
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens ' greatest problem.	2.2717340854463512
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.	1.95311966459166
Second reading of the Florenz report (A5-0006/2000)	1.7003390740674746
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.	2.5236678755041577
Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.	2.621781187486696
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty.	1.699663216511845
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses.	2.3373310943137926
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.	2.486221610030984
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	3.2206766671561278
And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop.	1.713974391031431
The Commission appreciates Parliament ' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role.	2.8678363082395815
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter.	2.616764032469478
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	1.9282921092639618
It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector.	1.9145499068265917
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.	2.314160388846065
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine.	2.253704774196307
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	2.8658204450081297
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies.	2.0836377803357475
. (DA) The Left ' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today ' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers ' diplomatic sanctions against Austria.	2.2535168057581467
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6008080479545364
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs.	2.4372925171267577
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique.	1.9387062301943083
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries.	2.1517048700857573
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.	2.334599664523114
I ask for your support.	3.256571911000052
It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.	2.765821170167702
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	1.4603471299871524
Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery?	2.337258058745028
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me, within the foreseeable future, of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.	2.3437637014906807
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.	2.0765751917946083
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	2.4947532593045247
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland.	2.1866522821586907
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.	3.598319861579056
Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent.	1.6357729372604184
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	2.454501943844393
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results.	2.161570896357506
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	2.3125261989680275
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail.	2.1550522304433315
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.	2.3031813495937405
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	2.662737366561416
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	3.0010049006877657
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	1.8821126015667529
I salute Mr Schmidt.	3.7083262707425457
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.	3.5946570936044075
I certainly appreciate that.	3.496351714515711
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	2.2367032150604227
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	2.925926416446163
Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence.	1.9826822669590212
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	1.836436939835068
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	2.2403292024866297
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	2.421814221433578
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	2.0997624985321353
In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.	1.797294893201639
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate.	2.5199290010384714
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	1.803509714156576
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.	2.2348377990694774
Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one.	2.419921442160108
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.	2.0424899366240634
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality ', 'gender ' and 'women ' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe '.	1.6767824543486065
Mr President, as a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia, I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues. I shall, of course, be brief.	2.242359551970699
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost.	1.5342000336121429
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	2.3545885311191874
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	1.7348835979818005
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	1.554285373020655
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive.	2.5798902935888233
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known.	1.890417466473651
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.	1.996229792694912
What she has said here is completely justified.	2.4057091131472226
Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency.	3.2624673864271503
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice.	2.1625969880175506
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today.	2.2709425477118255
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.	2.20620532890662
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	1.639238261380007
In particular, the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems, improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment, in the graded management of coastal areas, improved training, information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management.	1.7450624900828107
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.	2.7229627206375726
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	2.622972033358168
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.	4.568260847322151
Furthermore, 90% of businesses active in tourism are small or medium-sized, the very enterprises which form the living cells of our social and economic tissue, which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development.	2.0073597835600903
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal ' s point of view.	2.4064509137002923
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon.	2.7843387430053266
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe.	2.4530472961973118
We need to do something about it.	3.478749082929057
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.	2.2636149157903973
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	2.4444810984770764
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.	2.0331809854945746
In six months ' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation ' s effects upon the Commission ' s role.	2.851035058168342
- (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	2.5841680475631175
The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income.	2.1235362162863263
There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers.	2.0053215825038384
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.	2.3381227284899713
In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective.	2.3660699715682805
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	2.6848137580178277
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise.	2.4669386509126676
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	2.584806510865138
It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, "the brown plague" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory.	1.878004327060932
. (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out.	2.875631783530515
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.	3.067619942722522
And how should we achieve this?	2.2917949049632984
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer ' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?	2.0396252961452217
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	2.150943969101567
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.	2.5309811318956554
We are extremely disappointed.	3.4306844236209244
This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group ' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen.	2.1163522007404563
However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle.	2.0618236467866478
I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things.	2.6459641431869567
What has been done about training?	2.9224412532534383
It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message.	2.524210764603232
Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example, how much progress are you willing to make and what measures, legislative or otherwise, will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings, child pornography on the Internet, drugs, and organised crime?	1.6304405223424474
It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser.	1.9610801562785252
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	2.0846667295575525
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	2.182394700977903
Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential.	2.5344343084043266
In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments ' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.	1.916717506950388
Certainly not!	1.7369918458170406
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.	2.447028442777245
Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight.	2.1491210452230605
We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier.	2.1551216325674325
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	1.5122543995613704
In creating a citizens ' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.	2.3624367128429946
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution.	2.0501575961486727
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary.	2.789124799086263
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term.	2.367958182549547
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements.	2.0773482811214645
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council.	2.7503733298646815
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes.	1.5374372472000881
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	2.7021774924418356
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.	2.31791837837636
I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.	2.4323669885219616
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	2.1393249911177197
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	1.9422950499689386
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and, on the other, more widespread exclusion.	2.439785990961035
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.	2.377994388544527
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.	2.4000502727334223
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	2.1222682571538196
I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.	1.9629161387928988
Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.	2.4005351919989026
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.	1.7642032363836977
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	2.685375428861047
In Reunion, for example, the rate is 37%.	3.223469955238005
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.	2.4366992434989454
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry.	1.7445528583606829
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	1.9556480476678302
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	2.029313046395427
I can show you a copy if you wish.	2.5903622045513903
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	2.5739004426899914
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	2.473132642900416
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	2.2238066621431876
Mr President, I am grateful for the Council ' s oral, and also written, reply.	2.6094387791202656
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?	2.2133884108195594
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.	2.420160775630803
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	2.074654524757983
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved.	1.861102233961249
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	2.4864643391258805
Can you?	2.401503427805788
As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	2.323345788671039
There are huge reserves; certain zones, rural zones, so-called zones lagging behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitats, are listed as having good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism.	1.636192123371098
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament ' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	2.602066328895447
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.	2.552276077292932
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage.	1.8197808623214673
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier ' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	2.499519834200392
I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft" .	1.87690399982326
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria ' s Freedom Party.	1.9414324940568
We cannot afford to waste time.	2.8358230170651653
For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance.	2.925376671940535
Questions to Mrs Wallström	1.7043727370407744
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques ' .	1.871301785701332
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	1.6683280323231524
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.	3.3343136337379864
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market.	2.3137144297885097
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens ' tax money?	2.443995519951772
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?	1.8675184932324818
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider.	2.736228312215554
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function.	2.9612216712671158
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.	2.550837803603988
You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere.	2.421921721679663
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	2.058013547573119
In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners ' in all measures taken under the new CSF?	2.2765091677907905
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.	2.0276899949507983
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.	2.2230983259693646
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.	2.956113480067742
This is the citizen of a state ' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	2.5831757804409468
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.8025257316374503
That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form.	2.152863965446369
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision.	2.485369210693463
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	2.310159293312932
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	2.2590711580799083
Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us.	2.0229911850844813
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.	2.613827949449869
The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster.	2.391721789325653
This Parliament ' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	2.850500074559661
First, by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly, as recommended in the Corrie report, thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged (regional economic partnership agreements).	1.82755745143351
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product.	1.9413987790974307
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	1.619138359441816
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect.	1.7861256233498586
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people ' s health.	2.440645860774788
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	2.5317066094875083
I did not hide behind any immunity.	2.9497603378906354
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level?	2.6886148218379735
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988.	2.2958776181745475
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	2.5741504938585775
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	2.0948029498143548
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked.	1.5732135458937768
On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed.	3.0165795037008194
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.	3.253510369970141
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	2.686038787678933
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission ' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.	2.3899023229377456
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	1.9267080631953777
We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	2.4219079088670474
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	2.3970791935941738
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject.	2.1299649443606707
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	1.8792294614800789
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world.	1.71184497972609
As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	2.0642988307424366
The European Union ' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.	2.2485088792561894
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	1.8350400348741398
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	2.504881605192623
The Commission ' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	2.157092565226147
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	2.16679357498735
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	2.0879516603147845
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.	2.2038155267613453
We congratulate you.	4.161575684355436
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	2.1215283089380943
However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	2.140454477349162
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	1.9398933395150841
This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy.	2.5239214089288553
As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency.	2.066473858784776
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.	3.189222307313483
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	2.758980195179152
I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.3780249910662326
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision.	2.478752942298216
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen.	2.0566537357598413
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products.	2.020686260719249
. (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission ' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union.	2.4276147725341413
However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved.	2.525100988304045
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.	2.0910974725148987
Resumption of the session	1.14747099996588
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	3.3738251407745015
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.	1.7765274138173164
However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws.	3.0415184252588974
This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen.	2.2764806474204473
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	2.185071356960934
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	2.1099118027865345
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	2.290551749362555
As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters.	2.3312471042865854
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.	2.335398632628836
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	1.7142975179598503
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming.	2.8581066571857603
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	2.210376214563261
As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.	2.0845219899250944
I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints.	3.822982282177436
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	2.3394007506980823
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	2.5230820989726155
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	2.1581202771651515
I look forward to the next round.	3.198439593052391
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.6539263613583564
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	2.056147825867881
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission.	2.702043847425212
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.	2.3603153895700943
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	1.709022824598008
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.	2.646683046983659
When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence.	2.232832810096651
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	2.768931100151412
While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion.	2.3257393089764244
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	1.7130911923431935
Moreover, what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action?	2.1810554182247763
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	2.4237125201058536
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party ' s summit meeting.	2.0233073944431204
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.	3.038843622013073
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.	2.188891300497674
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	3.2272739265854136
My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.	2.45450054045188
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector.	3.5161493648182844
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission ' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.	3.0440316739002173
I also welcome the White Paper.	2.7283947335024155
Helsinki was an historic event, an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point.	1.446835162394083
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	2.3143516072240176
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	2.7006865425999953
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.520444581370218
Our priorities (i.e. the "left-overs" ) must be:	1.8877692287902152
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.	1.7988514379285332
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	2.0222846071289267
.	1.374839594702952
I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it.	2.6669140684518484
Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget.	2.272100850263062
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.	2.2508570806410773
They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.	1.6291224878723902
Thirdly: it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails.	2.997621654685278
Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.	1.7237017845978797
We therefore have a number of amendments.	4.099053442133914
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	3.088172896492328
We will try to address them, but it is not easy.	3.709957929127703
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	3.230615937162909
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.	3.729688995753001
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission 's proposal.	2.347954848348768
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.	2.5324288131049095
Nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14, which is contrary to the Commission ' s right of initiative.	2.350523184375323
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	1.5861858115116072
First: we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways.	1.686950442031286
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.	1.641025050828664
I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear, proper economic and biological picture emerging.	2.1154145514596845
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	2.2995953648483245
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	2.237556289049755
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.	2.2564306577310216
It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock.	1.8885255609401035
In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence.	2.581772522947066
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	2.078696459394396
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	2.057530898544256
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	3.5463694549258857
Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years.	2.2134368666112527
More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils.	1.9610795596900987
The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years.	2.925393346721322
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	1.6871984125428303
On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level.	1.912812683803221
Report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Draft Framework Decision on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)	1.6585001482044186
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?	1.5658551803231096
What we need here is an integral approach.	2.178716418084718
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	1.9361866317010166
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament.	2.6481205863974333
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned.	1.6749663105268737
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today.	2.3162467793493136
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	2.225390308965103
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	2.5226857456714264
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	2.139407348618398
In my view, it is, therefore, immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and, consequently, to study and approve the provisions referred to here.	1.7793979435762128
Mr President, Mrs Theato ' s report on the protection of the European Union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.	2.734079733398764
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	2.661645565060518
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	2.253695303874186
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole.	2.4652116186256876
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.	2.0752720093411843
Questions to Mr Barnier	1.756094336658378
There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital.	1.8945464414997635
There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation.	2.3307795989882916
But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision.	2.0179038643344147
Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.	3.1017522318175046
Parliament ' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations.	1.8891535460274798
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission ' s proposal on Mr Böge ' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	2.7543629845594597
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	2.123704602057621
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries.	2.1657109706424307
In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society.	2.703455435109172
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	2.2785956771255638
Will it do the same to us?	1.9984277302513458
In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.	2.39325538723798
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	2.533096831466534
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?	1.9648296085327936
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.	2.278291746530925
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	1.8699825552370697
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda.	2.9792045056189895
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms.	3.283419401242632
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	2.3910537198597304
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again.	2.99552577263023
With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers ' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job.	2.0075374856588177
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	2.5072426658501996
As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million.	2.1526309712625515
Mr President, Mrs Karamanou ' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact.	2.7727765952422034
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	2.117616685123818
It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape.	2.178459797352734
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.	1.8511000289072868
We shall address this problem and check all the translations.	2.554128458671749
Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced.	1.6690921969458685
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	2.190699526271064
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	2.612054838499312
To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one.	1.809458604891868
I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped, in line with the Commission ' s proposal.	2.3287574219324876
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.	2.389339307947557
So this is what we are going to do.	3.282249689000549
In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.	2.0062430517977985
.	1.374839594702952
But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind.	2.196497767983755
In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat.	2.155801851443896
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.	2.053753553207253
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.	1.4025539200732504
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.	1.7839702089049998
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry!	2.247649645949121
Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence.	2.6178382222272245
She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras.	2.3657206308548675
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found.	2.0235552066067664
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	2.5027809500356346
All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.	2.318634392608167
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.	3.5810399072084342
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.7737084791327264
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	2.715748370685882
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements.	1.440042429488787
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France 's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France?	2.4278263056039084
Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level.	2.287051299510437
Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions.	1.5805208563247943
As rightly said by the rapporteur, both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval.	2.4897293372597398
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	2.3556705657226593
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.	1.8701377739876042
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman 's office.	3.0595202017153875
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.	2.3060993218574843
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.	1.7165331679905143
We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments.	2.2791145515475737
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine.	2.009897394323778
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about.	3.5081089122678413
The Commission ' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.	2.122794943865092
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	2.369893414058751
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	2.5269244438484835
We cannot accept this.	3.346108953974188
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	1.9440420406616061
Still on judicial cooperation, considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro, and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance.	2.418037794263406
There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups.	2.049266756398065
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.	1.93505582616855
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential.	2.6046042111911287
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	3.232107455958618
He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.	1.7967154735718514
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	1.8523959391782854
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.	2.274717041064059
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.	2.7089809985499187
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia ' s stability.	1.8157655383689302
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members.	2.581495195972664
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met.	2.29279689780506
This is part of risk management.	2.9431884071441483
Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe.	1.6986840334374018
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	2.4787996247048314
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.	3.637772141715024
(FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise.	1.6229363407393544
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	2.670921474650654
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation.	1.54954026923345
The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets.	2.661451330504979
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.	2.8048809675565844
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives.	3.015801722982341
The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission.	3.017355195523425
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	2.3310914371691807
On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State.	2.3085477029696784
I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine ' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	2.5973335221867364
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	2.5600405192407334
This would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future.	2.3764198204776323
The company went under despite this.	2.924701471855923
I passionately defend Europe ' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	2.9912786005365213
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field.	2.071215205557507
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	1.8721108374649105
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?	2.4231931392479855
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?	1.847143546122411
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.	2.4163324832857134
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	2.364064234019996
LEADER+ should supplement already existing programmes, avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible.	1.680489564602248
It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment.	2.215274481632627
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	2.3444717068750207
Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail.	3.0075139753864573
We support that.	3.9908797932951656
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.	2.196076543553505
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.	2.1960732061710857
Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.	1.883077280417261
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	2.2346186050100503
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.	1.7106576799877222
Question No 2 by (H-0024/00):	1.8952530871060338
I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia, in Galicia, for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products, on a site which will only employ three workers. This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa, where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry.	1.9407286732791247
It is not the European Parliament ' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union ' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	2.637079515526632
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies.	2.087112524018699
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.	2.8459537336016902
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	3.3795114596175586
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.	2.759097758089765
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	2.738758773296676
As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	1.91185116864685
Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well.	1.7277291059819957
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	2.432819518874405
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	2.18883146710726
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.	1.9377760510493358
The Commission ' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging.	2.56026577471827
The debate is a deeply political one.	2.54932093775744
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	2.60913003913501
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.	1.686755287182774
Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.	1.7520940338713324
In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union ' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallström has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan.	2.027065009100597
In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office.	2.021449998642949
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.	2.194615554714882
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.	2.6262859663392377
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women ' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.	2.3309414752512794
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	2.930137127386245
President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans.	2.0428646955405485
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.	1.6996291059407032
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions.	2.7394778047337955
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison.	2.4910704848186676
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes.	2.588456250697948
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	2.1294399027112383
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.	2.525284390726866
So when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchanges of information, particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution.	2.69664865256762
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.	2.94041910802218
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	3.3203096341326312
Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong.	1.8796382605727657
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.	2.157221581877398
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	3.028986387093331
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability.	2.7451419440749727
This too is a particular desire of my group.	2.492988950172253
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote.	1.9595148011284353
Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble.	2.5498506720989673
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union.	2.1389583113081923
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning.	2.7512112314835893
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner.	2.910246694640319
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance.	1.7793945613557423
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.	2.8124195139743557
The Commission must listen to it.	2.844693718567429
Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration" . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration" .	1.7045532160575882
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	1.6991778845318999
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	2.157290175931709
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.	2.489696327460367
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	2.3234770331373857
You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away.	1.8855620268068691
More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective.	1.8762199938766568
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.	2.4165832132031206
Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future.	2.059982275861267
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	2.118888531478449
Nor is it a mere luxury.	1.8909053818292956
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.	2.4869939534774796
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	3.1819905204289207
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying.	2.7903813769128605
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	2.3380232774987753
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.	1.9953300356317427
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	1.9460949607978841
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	2.750530731079796
It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties.	2.4221041583468934
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission ' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.	2.314324516263489
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach.	2.269526900693328
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country.	2.5350572801376168
That is why it is so important.	2.298515191769357
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.	3.1266387604622543
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services.	2.4971153102744608
Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area.	2.030514367934917
However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve.	1.9899209077079956
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.	2.5353596922192922
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	2.1321637154264104
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	3.034425083313838
(End of fiction).	1.2916403678580899
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.	2.3407457943354184
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.	3.175035846893906
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	2.5676117511294385
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	2.3114930646579603
We need to wait and see what happens there.	2.6748359740562075
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	2.396211916058196
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	2.1999890077632767
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.	2.0314278019045453
In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa ' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU ' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	1.9072426763959678
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	2.9694935380357133
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	1.9428623579827515
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.	2.2581113272167084
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	1.4746065899420946
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	1.8721040066506325
At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated.	2.1829903173610012
That is where the potential is.	2.59664772475677
What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased.	2.1939601968740616
Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater.	2.1096896166168304
The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here.	2.035659686037224
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.	2.39589274138496
Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply.	2.8924793340397077
We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.	2.910396245026301
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.	3.0557268916404343
That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment, so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment.	1.9019820651073582
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	2.3834095569040175
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.	2.4732878212450617
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	2.7471607667069886
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set.	1.9571057236651135
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.	2.184141292210957
It concerns the next IGC.	2.947696180002018
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	1.791623551378352
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	1.9872546605330748
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	2.5448735915130483
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep? ' .	2.0103442209570903
It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light.	2.2318967376374745
Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible.	1.894252670448818
All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.	1.7139326763948373
I urge the Commission to be less cautious.	3.793516434570301
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	2.162373920995554
And no one can comprehend this attitude.	2.210011468067096
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.	2.09549015332922
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.	2.3920749925896962
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	2.110396388395942
Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.	1.8455559151555812
I would, however, like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date.	2.7515281149823934
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.	2.461786124520839
Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges.	2.4394471666591127
The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today.	1.8363313607372276
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament ' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.	2.2840882788293912
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	2.6272914633423463
I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water.	2.177832164210615
First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	2.2063346489544795
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	2.555093488845862
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.	2.1682259616132775
Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones.	2.586224063291977
Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly.	1.622649846731327
Thank you for your reply.	1.8799470643006613
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.	2.2430684201202364
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	2.7245111521916043
Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies.	2.2696941275680267
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.	2.0356455646615736
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	1.3558634749399148
Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future?	2.63554676196872
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	1.8734228274169407
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.	1.7305726097115046
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.	2.1402819964033615
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	2.383770860863984
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire. '	1.9647360956472113
I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed.	2.500586381356801
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings.	2.461990442028738
We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.	2.283852865294391
This question covers several individual matters.	2.623121476532632
I am convinced that the Bible, God ' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values.	2.221022013749398
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	1.9257837492996948
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.	1.6618629627510784
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.	1.9219323631269474
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry.	2.1991360183407576
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.	1.9431517022081757
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.	2.4675060456136353
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.	2.7119269085672135
These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection.	2.797854523092764
To give you an example, in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions, the equivalents of the English words: "in so far as" have been omitted.	1.8246529403553569
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	2.0178148293042812
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.	2.7524229710650485
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.	2.5491199192696383
Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.	2.4904789361789397
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.	2.950227936536069
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.	2.07139886565728
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges.	2.1813813008589973
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	2.7781185980986676
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far, perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks.	2.215857637284692
So there is a whole raft of contradictions.	3.0533463585725755
With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.	2.3441399215415593
Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau.	1.6721949820402116
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.	2.302299902631891
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.	3.128868761476052
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	2.467324025978086
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	1.9913635522256925
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.	2.724997039792703
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds.	2.5970157195848222
. Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility ' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries.	2.2537614222963596
I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	2.997847340517589
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned.	1.973672569303967
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK.	2.035128187070842
On a separate matter altogether, I would like to support Cuba ' s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.	2.5326530268147756
What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly.	2.1652471900676598
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.	3.3774448950642153
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	2.058758776389075
An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society.	1.8483136973700274
So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission ' s duty.	2.763624936807773
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	2.6065459231643695
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	1.6293714338629364
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves.	2.598856523772071
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	2.2116857293964123
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	1.662775389886629
However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership ' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance.	1.8716907337651205
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	2.1129243242510953
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.	1.9084010081770206
In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities.	3.200931641134903
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.	3.0673098859590686
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself. As I have told Parliament, the task before us is immense and ambitious, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge.	2.423617326993572
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.	1.9423808197826813
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	3.0264577608636576
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.	3.045071158340573
The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty.	2.1197655169527865
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians.	2.299928409792822
The Commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	2.465901438675915
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	2.141756732505647
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	2.6442143793882535
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	2.3867023144219157
This means that we move away from shredding.	2.9536881188805544
That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere.	2.6809634738264227
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment.	1.9019144721505723
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.	2.738725961261103
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	2.5817552028828636
In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers ' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	2.1232428190606507
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.	2.536862774329856
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything.	2.307635838515301
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention.	2.3971287207783534
Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy.	2.032676715795538
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	3.340209192974667
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters.	2.1980946844513545
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.	2.698799373768083
Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime.	2.2541533516517602
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?	2.009527820670028
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	1.7909811551548145
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment.	1.794669257616981
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.	2.421070686657438
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	2.007006499622049
However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President.	2.1464627781822436
In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data.	2.118446074870793
As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings.	2.54578317101648
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	2.5125287170343955
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	2.113668682933044
The WWF reports that, according to Italian, French and Spanish customs authorities, illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase.	1.9654900127231698
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.	1.6501161671920235
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	2.015748604033964
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured.	1.8859234609155944
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective.	2.573535152385752
We want to talk about coherence.	3.2981339083409598
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.	1.9843065526445052
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.	2.031254544810816
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	2.45338934956521
(Applause, heckling)	1.2834676391182434
We really hope and believe so.	2.92502790295031
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	2.96527473373759
I come from a rural area.	3.0620677824400224
Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.	2.6055144540846378
There is, therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union, a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself.	2.9357729233573933
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive.	2.568140042986516
So it is a step forward.	3.03373584299718
The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations.	2.547158563578391
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	2.034679026472403
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	1.8535817102434526
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism.	2.089686129196979
Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly.	2.7552497460388596
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.	1.966332082675299
Mr President, I just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the House also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the Austrian anti-racist associations who are honouring us with a visit.	2.193841353184822
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.	2.6105661233062487
What establishes a recognised minority?	2.3891025640162162
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider ' s.	2.1344062086133198
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.	1.6854894644344087
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	3.8970034288738313
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	1.92922282494719
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I have therefore voted in favour of it.	2.6741993158412374
II. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (9614/1999 - C5-0167/1999 - 1999/0805(CNS)	1.644317040671757
So far there have been no infringements of the law.	2.3476053192892516
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems.	2.258511378418443
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol.	1.9088944486775055
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.	2.459227788617008
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	1.8936472887568667
Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error.	2.6663370793648524
I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Knörr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency.	2.1026524474460877
I also stressed the need for prevention.	4.056888474166434
The New York stage is different from Geneva.	2.805289143205934
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	2.175242440367674
This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment.	3.4054128236779073
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.	2.6164149488810886
Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future.	2.250381900542873
In a fortnight ' s time, I shall be in Berlin.	2.600496152400918
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	2.3838830273873945
If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative.	2.7253828347242517
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	2.0769935910052957
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform	2.8748862074711226
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations.	2.245575709192074
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.	2.8216944558365515
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient.	2.7077122521466945
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	2.0529322218348627
This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well.	2.1055692486170274
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.	1.7059853589851028
Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven.	2.2723789325247146
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	2.1632057900866584
I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving.	2.0512900933248
By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter.	2.0087774812838037
If we do this, then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount.	1.8575288472224791
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	2.1653323997412013
This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.	1.8568192210938368
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future.	3.0619979072699857
A very important proposal indeed.	2.3229269381864865
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU 's areas of competence.	2.0415924458346035
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance ' .	2.1718893213960584
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies.	1.752680548577766
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities.	2.3657467633640756
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.	2.7044080703788316
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	2.39695332551111
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	2.725390513076961
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.	2.6946026618587164
CULTURE 2000	1.322338402406092
Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.	2.5280739620156587
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	2.7147073255212
The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world ' s most important reserve currencies.	2.7128742638830863
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.	2.1236973632615532
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good.	2.1867046149998393
It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire.	3.0298973847080526
It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union.	2.5129372740886633
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	2.829625911896006
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.	2.2108500603887244
They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital.	1.8985610276152496
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	3.006904447262317
In reality, the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic.	2.2141325964886924
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique?	2.2060506439420973
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	2.2292113166729624
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.	1.8863498724765155
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.	1.6881569113139874
Strasbourg, 17 February" .	1.2589730444496103
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.	2.3735805343364267
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	1.3515766297236924
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	2.413291634970928
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	2.3165657119130088
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens ' representatives.	2.8573050321331985
Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us.	1.6392222114071295
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.	1.943319091749427
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from, among others, scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully.	2.0737483665070617
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.	2.643977614843417
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	2.5652116125398123
We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe?	2.2468422099233587
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.	2.9417549960848737
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.	1.8056810273381732
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection.	1.3997024087254548
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.	3.1697973931887424
It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states.	2.0838148558243406
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.020797597978323
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	2.376162238210048
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.	2.12769440234247
We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	1.6422678582435268
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states.	2.0481023223297012
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	2.186822890111616
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.	2.5023328469251607
From this vantage point, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy.	1.955591707085802
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	1.5567506714489439
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	2.956611276010414
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	2.2384713075451597
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.	2.364796436230964
The new operational environment is, above all, a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before.	2.1592918268332197
By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament ' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III.	2.3907111319021
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so.	2.7977531937410482
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	2.417551455114878
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict.	2.9433223610117496
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	2.5558267942778934
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government.	1.947515422626361
We will raise that, too, in the representations we make.	2.3507131944437947
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	2.4603330870658158
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.	2.5209365533783252
As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.	2.234551886306839
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	2.806460849916578
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats ' request to hold the vote on Friday.	2.9233342286509396
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example.	1.4857042545679582
It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.	2.106598343265291
Not that we do so every week.	2.6352311985793735
We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	2.1956169384543913
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	2.3531965807457804
We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights.	2.345760329563884
The Commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States ' courts.	3.452673587776503
The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed.	2.5041868145315234
We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas.	1.695500259974684
Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary.	2.630433436964306
.	1.374839594702952
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	1.8328487783028873
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	2.60633399236384
- (FR) Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis, all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	2.2216446824933005
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables.	3.7870219530993023
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing.	1.9945061711664924
That is naturally unacceptable.	2.6456780509478777
So that is at least a step forward.	2.3097592421326048
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	1.7048837829015302
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	2.3353120807444734
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.	2.500555622388131
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.	2.7622952192905372
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making.	2.179619671115314
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency, then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market.	2.4691026116861416
The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation.	2.448132238597416
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount.	3.395924377589757
The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties.	2.7874152106287373
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	1.9888191300383458
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	2.1949598300748145
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.	5.0046912625894695
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	2.4841539529316177
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.	3.1234266225540046
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.	2.315674283500021
Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete.	2.417712961539193
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	2.240614627270105
European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used.	1.8096469727472788
However, some people ' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators.	2.156607424224807
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs.	3.1272043159371212
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.	2.6179402299164565
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	2.9542789170209907
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission ' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives.	3.1139633159925393
Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge.	1.3459140425208411
Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.	2.1220179850428393
Brok report (A5-0029/2000)	1.3781980441005723
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):	1.797228348273236
Personally, I am pleased with some of the replies, for example, in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention, which we hope will be reviewed, and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.	2.4050686837575053
Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time.	2.418777109279471
These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing.	2.092614177072549
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.	3.265549150957826
As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.	2.187046300152075
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.	2.39667324181243
As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports.	2.269508366211615
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16.	2.016991215156969
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.	2.158214809290527
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.	1.8513584668425913
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State.	2.619231675150956
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward.	2.571544689948007
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.	2.3025727149878716
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	2.613954353665902
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne 's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.	2.0643939397210262
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	2.2091312669195684
Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want.	1.8043640785880912
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	2.68289148598332
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies.	2.0175145553551537
Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests.	1.6988549443755239
In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed.	2.075635623387666
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	2.021871790568227
. (SV) Olle Schmidt ' s report is an improvement on the Commission ' s proposal.	2.5530733371076897
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.	2.0727992576003156
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	2.0846711617896316
They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU ' s population growth.	1.9468900108307252
By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society.	2.0868105445522147
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."	1.9356832329620999
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	2.402717258080144
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable.	2.087961965272117
Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem.	2.969136278872378
We shall now move on to Question Time.	2.52022029059497
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	2.326144595658429
Criminal law is part of each individual nation ' s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts.	2.3838019257829046
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	1.9884228166771578
Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	1.5338916562957852
The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles.	3.0267179455099167
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	2.1518409727412173
This is an important matter.	3.1758355312945743
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.	1.8514350434518954
For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption.	2.4203053602902163
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.	2.6109670677579224
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism?	2.8258284988902007
As you know, on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth.	1.8750416200618365
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.	2.119443469227066
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	2.439734433230824
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	2.8310019139046125
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	2.555163172367655
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.	1.751979263264935
However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity.	2.1882743574433934
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.	2.901041770023498
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour.	2.203497806921197
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.	2.4052179903842044
We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours.	2.906439217803908
It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips.	1.9167826452777508
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	2.1418899743812005
In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia ' s U-turn.	2.19774612477263
Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.	2.7199291556857452
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets.	2.4240807364131327
	1.0510108151299706
In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby.	2.0811216792719924
Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.	2.5523741033857155
There are different views on this.	2.3597070874822155
The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination.	2.36055349580169
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.	2.090525218754208
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability.	2.690983234956221
It is as simple as that.	2.6340069234148884
However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime.	1.914872520173721
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights.	2.317383458416873
In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	2.6162679619952303
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	2.355242869066182
So what is the European Union doing about it?	3.6248539659156513
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	1.684700984207727
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger.	2.9888135103496585
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	2.2736574110831786
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration.	2.289357897290378
He is a driven man, a competent man.	1.7612974784208593
I am surprised it has even been made, because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents.	2.2517038752452314
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.	2.367083753320475
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.	2.954427112552052
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.	2.2030096616669277
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	2.09101289192481
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	2.4220615888920944
Report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS)	1.6933803833813244
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.	2.9421250124436975
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	2.2133174665936903
Finally, Mr Prodi ' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	1.9434405923293627
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights ' section.	2.043108021240967
For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life.	2.104707709910487
The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.	2.41914427894687
This, however, does not seem feasible.	1.949372373314315
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	2.0655651887190363
However, we should look a little more closely at some points.	2.4687309347017417
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	2.605246431334193
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	2.486090641215645
It is the Tisza, Hungary ' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt.	1.7991406498432287
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job.	2.6356740234217066
Subject: High infant mortality levels in Kosovo According to the most recent UN information forwarded to the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe. About 50% of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages.	1.9245528449948945
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	1.65013504671101
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel ' s balanced report makes clear.	1.8407702986280934
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval.	2.5904669779202645
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive.	2.0433640831217
So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress.	1.942500056147893
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people ' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	1.7193975714590413
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.	3.6663086951228947
Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on.	1.7677069860647063
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.	2.9743759325705215
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time.	2.3125585063323686
We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned.	2.435389424011783
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	2.063065573796706
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	2.01348718653984
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence.	2.555442410654272
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	2.0346390173801994
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.	2.4082001478193797
The denominations of the euro are well known.	3.5331435330330176
It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously.	2.218275349009953
Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand.	2.311391152941481
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission ' s officials, which has been quite excellent.	3.815123549045534
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability ' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	2.098170967808035
We must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions, and I quote, that "If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council ' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition" .	2.2547728372633933
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	1.8941039530021573
Relating to Amendment No 31	1.815024006819234
This seems to be a good thing and useful.	4.1346432599922185
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?	2.6259495296535595
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives.	2.3024422499010515
This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it.	1.9694513003761374
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission ' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components.	1.989781155723546
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	2.9459794414406733
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament ' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	2.709538274577089
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	1.7945556276508599
The situation of Turkey 's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy.	2.278999871562169
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	2.422214620225286
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	2.7684939144609064
Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles.	1.6458603882466318
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00):	1.8113994555562247
We say that we want to protect human rights.	3.958664260061333
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	1.9906648042464523
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	3.115496554462306
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	2.1676223553112823
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard ' .	1.616665343742849
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.	2.4961414960982977
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.	2.359452938274676
You are a first class European.	2.2403742541437337
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement.	2.7746184251272816
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	1.8326853221960928
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	2.4433100787545188
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee ' s work?	1.788617525109662
Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	2.1260617178001597
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	1.9383559940330077
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives.	2.5396506418395908
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa.	2.16361930188988
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.	1.817535679776954
For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area.	2.229132645644304
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	1.6334420372125529
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	1.9558853279206379
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	2.1445741368941618
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.	2.3382830815351676
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty.	2.8508600164463855
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.	3.180981331442513
This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union.	2.3625020179429184
Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another.	2.417092120699701
Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society.	2.7614215446915824
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country ' s statutes to another ' s.	1.8167108134325316
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	2.1870409575989305
During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.	2.376315087653766
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	2.1323105905042
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	2.0282305748889478
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	2.140625373205
Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now.	2.218057212788466
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.	2.3361148462314185
I agree with this request.	3.8318145447402703
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations.	2.425728022981964
However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations.	2.8739477670568663
I think the statement ' s content makes this clear.	2.5855771243264267
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO.	2.1947660660777113
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	2.1565735149747756
After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail.	2.3091215177307487
Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices.	1.8609328941162229
Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.	2.7762661465483776
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at.	2.799927918151923
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union ' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU ' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.	2.579546574285898
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	1.9853033038829695
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission 's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	2.3958430100667507
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	2.062332431461173
States can carry out port inspections.	1.471290755117527
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment.	1.6553141736331336
Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality.	1.87293000192587
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.	2.513062393079491
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.	2.699269223943383
It is a retrograde step.	2.990894529101185
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	1.5883237454164614
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	2.228146230870235
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.	2.6856765037064916
The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles.	2.475378236631113
Very well: that is to be the unchanging rule.	3.344377989565169
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.	2.163012838001298
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	2.362192086976379
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion ' rather than 'regional development ' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.	2.4933446635716723
On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.	2.219246233570884
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	1.8819361550201263
The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works.	2.654076244751366
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba ' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	2.6256650664141334
If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo.	1.9253782965138124
First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative.	2.87219948639005
Mr President, in accordance with Article 69 (2), I call for referral back to committee.	2.2786606737664994
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	1.893971066749448
So what do we need to happen immediately?	3.1941082374067546
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards.	2.227154557577554
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	1.966874319035762
The other area of conflict is more difficult.	2.569710187902079
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed.	2.132893547865853
But where will you place the emphasis?	2.385498032070997
Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements.	2.213471063119394
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.	1.7905493698901132
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.	2.1452687811789026
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.	2.7991115768342247
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.	2.9388036978139387
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	2.1592709183252894
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	1.5790860644592655
On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging.	2.335079662176265
The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	1.8091860884638757
The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year ' s General Assembly, certainly not at the Geneva session.	2.6860744005240487
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.	2.667687757066851
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.	1.8323919767841375
We will therefore vote for the Greens ' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	2.1484192150357324
The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo, that is to say, to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States.	2.1554620183394215
It is a miracle that they were saved.	2.752925793513357
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.	1.915257755771623
ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned.	1.6471523517407276
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.	2.420624541273228
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness.	2.5800107167453734
An essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible.	2.965968562365761
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	2.4033388988189395
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.	1.8764931752638214
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	2.4137923566649016
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House.	3.704010166574685
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	2.165614104542523
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	2.1673417816140312
We have a new Commission.	3.1185329888569444
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure.	2.7646398654355933
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo Núñez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	1.9496508388648701
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.	1.9480112443631428
This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool ' s bargain for French taxpayers.	1.9482304758972893
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):	1.7924168922174466
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this.	2.477578456100505
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.	2.5443612192016483
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	2.5704578727812137
Urgent change is required today.	1.4260698558189544
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government.	1.7336973554293444
The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800.	2.2754272987213136
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.	1.6606875165645707
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future.	3.0596172472208867
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union ' s common foreign and security policy.	2.7442933051801015
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	1.9250447905549068
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures.	1.901291163342397
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.	2.2077208273686857
What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d ' Yeu or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch?	1.9881738611868196
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress.	2.964379828289354
Of course we need to modernise these systems.	2.4559586094835577
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	1.8548421358670284
My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.	2.189663407823172
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	2.3322533254465525
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.8355298615043112
In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant.	2.1100385172080123
My colleagues ' register of interests is complete.	2.2503216070610357
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	2.1105641695257167
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.	2.9597055557458116
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago.	2.386361476078787
Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament.	2.378753756639866
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels.	1.797419958002535
The Commission ' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	3.0209610104099838
The unease is justified.	3.636867154579583
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.	2.1751816027911937
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum.	1.2842393231976283
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	2.956530808735677
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control.	2.122113407759357
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	2.6473422345636903
As I have already said on a number of occasions, I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect, on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process, the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law, rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator.	2.553882030874701
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers.	2.095628971887369
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	1.7769589735488003
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.	1.7231505573767751
We must strike a balance between them.	2.9673715387656183
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations.	2.080638441920032
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions.	2.027375247925316
Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.	2.2453163203848354
Ten years ago, the "velvet revolution" proclaimed Havel na HRAD.	1.4402676380684216
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	2.157553142136056
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war.	2.198968190260866
I support Mrs Lienemann ' s firm stance.	2.999663281956024
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	2.106338638701843
In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997.	2.4920009588680196
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit.	1.952174971955294
What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability?	2.206915110478953
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.	1.8111703621822948
I refer to Eurodac.	3.5980737252364614
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.	2.111254831295709
My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.	1.595110057551191
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7.	2.2808225025955564
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	2.7119891163412664
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can.	2.202707140177865
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated.	2.109625832508764
This I think is the new Convention.	3.472394047972325
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	2.5534976614109803
Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group.	1.845118362829746
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published.	2.129018792751085
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.	1.8086130284275
Parliament is a separate subject.	2.4704016367155597
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	2.3888991065267384
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing, we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side.	2.219941992377811
That is, after all, a question the people often ask.	2.459795181238653
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes.	2.0678055659587087
Mr President, the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East.	2.4190222566151527
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!	2.109410083115083
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything.	1.5304098532934778
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.	2.961585310855449
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	2.9210266747442253
So how far have we come?	2.2609641522932136
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	3.2520694278262945
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	1.9999414099049009
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.	2.616678818739181
The Member States have spent similar amounts.	3.4791312501866174
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	2.202402604148553
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.	2.5251227408646275
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes.	2.8208345338377794
In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion.	2.1435914823096667
Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report.	2.4977478829996826
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	2.485838973165421
I say it again, the European Union ' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy.	2.8628549892807573
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	2.442105966743554
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	1.9795271568003028
Both documents, that is the Commission 's document and the Ombudsman 's draft, cover largely the same ground.	2.416191620791124
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	2.3353682005329834
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.	1.9560108612048164
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	2.51571114302669
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.786216035902907
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.	1.7662644251988788
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%?	2.0483065282175086
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	3.46883478674239
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	2.23535777926054
This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces.	2.0837525664988963
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.	2.288068872377381
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission.	2.3022710265523965
I emphatically support the rapporteur ' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.	3.2619989873593456
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.	2.286079856930436
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved.	1.7863413306361282
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens ' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU ' s Council of Ministers removed.	2.38862885053225
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	2.4507342784047417
In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!	2.211997230274212
Stand by universality and affordability!	1.4069674527517104
In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.	2.522976051839094
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	2.174778821165701
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate.	2.3849936626171675
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries.	3.098157312419998
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC.	2.9945238028585957
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.	3.3888143496575673
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership.	2.691534237128318
In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role . in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial. '	2.462333781102232
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	2.9182944206821264
Madam President, we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider ' s Freedom Party in Austria, which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part, and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people.	2.139885002173737
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	1.9735879137841386
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important.	3.129805380863997
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)	1.340463031220496
Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs.	2.24234527404016
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard.	2.065345495599475
Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality.	1.8640915631856458
It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission ' s best asset, its richest resource.	2.4365786784406995
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo.	2.258781336795734
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	1.8900462550590615
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.	1.7809775627923348
This will also be important with a view to the special summit in March, where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment.	2.4610397115338394
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.	2.190743668789821
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme.	2.2151961027179365
Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding.	2.1774550347561283
No, it does not!	1.8572301922192518
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.	1.9702117218653508
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.	1.8857133004868938
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	2.15851241998489
This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3.	2.1677983861203773
VOTE	1.0850475141586433
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.	2.6839954815233256
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament ' s backing.	2.377158794863699
We cannot afford to wait.	3.063886576177189
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.	1.8782675883523219
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	2.5813994360733243
Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.	1.8470769499399378
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.	2.453933093622241
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.	1.8040825535112237
For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this?	2.823478585309059
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries.	2.0890104305939867
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	1.9979197083058147
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	2.6738483140447538
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.	3.1569994033399915
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	2.959784281948761
The Council?	5.689983405211298
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	2.142683087599072
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?	2.4667506994495336
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States ' election processes?	2.2503949639355336
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union ' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union ' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view.	2.6580106458233748
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	2.3605526498711917
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	2.324509721403383
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.	1.9780227217177722
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	2.0660731479301484
Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.	1.6844463309745572
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion.	2.538349695318681
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	2.082490652584036
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation.	2.4089464019355513
The joint debate is closed.	2.7089246804683826
However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.	2.7374238492187795
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.	2.176039468261933
Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life.	2.1556742950690118
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans.	2.934404781441292
As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character.	1.952621164888215
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.	2.0919508917617824
First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk.	2.2590703354702777
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	2.209620638405197
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.	2.2314711673443854
The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales.	1.9435473866347492
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	2.549373229812923
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	2.450038235083133
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.	2.8393391783230326
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.	2.1127567894104655
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate.	3.847668485391858
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	1.882406225467279
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern.	2.2877915892714644
However, we do not have to resort to extreme solutions, as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report.	2.353882509756971
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices?	1.8530332618608236
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	2.2464267125024815
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	2.2223523939796865
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	2.743985134409296
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered.	2.461123409196132
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe ' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	2.728705223130489
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	1.6314866210467138
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.	2.365302680764357
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety.	2.239565610215664
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	2.383767971919254
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood.	1.9437809991477577
(FR) The European Union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions.	2.242974174265043
Clearly, the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, southern regions for example, is very different, and should be studied carefully.	1.965944172191765
It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed.	2.2308737194302517
The motion also asks that a position document, drawn up by the Commission and Council, should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF.	2.712157357231454
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	2.2181180297531964
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law.	2.673455412927981
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	2.0986816787344758
Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future?	1.8818784175713483
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	1.8435646400338628
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.	1.7898404108529948
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson.	2.3175427497947103
The attacks against Austria ' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	2.393089017282608
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low.	2.073006879313768
I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.	2.456625457019504
However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.	2.156031901223784
As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.	1.8816562836465582
The Commission has no means of influence here.	2.6822709887541882
Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin.	2.320935557739861
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.	3.0035402839277023
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.	2.008333457048042
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends ' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.	1.5954470223079777
The Mediterranean, particularly in some zones, is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value.	2.471079796627957
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993.	1.9321032252004526
Indeed, these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions, people who cannot return to their homes after the storms, purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist. They are no longer there, having been swept away in the torrents.	1.8060778704212483
(Loud, sustained applause from the centre and from the right, protests from the left)	1.614533297591509
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	2.3875587459704466
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations.	2.44065255948464
We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency.	2.266879916630771
We want to encourage debate among the people.	2.375421567965358
I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU ' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly.	2.7459680809602056
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.	1.529319741320701
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	3.2513991380241936
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	2.222443265478439
It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today.	2.787652345487221
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group.	2.3572515930896274
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.	2.5180467260270065
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?	2.1888319082001453
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	1.901599089266607
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session.	2.6954310349796864
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.	2.18730410255812
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	1.9367419693883803
The amendment to the directive on today 's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	2.3096428450373265
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	1.9946165930029882
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy ' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	2.1225338827767666
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	1.3967343233030123
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions.	2.3338283763088543
In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role.	2.4730551860107846
One is to adopt the Commission ' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible.	2.254108181207698
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement.	2.35455368387422
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).	2.1679026247713558
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	2.293124897054213
In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.	2.0456500640669777
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal.	2.6065843485747253
It is a fact that the road has been a long one, mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property.	2.639594021443604
What is the Council 's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?	2.76142057805167
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments.	3.439877425730784
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)	1.3430459253003428
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.	2.81252724098401
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you.	1.7850674776006945
Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered.	2.7973325070060264
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	2.0451887634738166
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?	1.607106719633785
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day ' s work to be done.	2.7078800949009514
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	1.6301643766154306
This goes against the Commission ' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	2.4941411291729683
This debate, I think, has summed it up.	2.436377931114258
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive.	2.778727321777759
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.	2.83189597506167
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs.	1.9445406190984653
Legal security requires this.	1.5738723836138686
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	2.808501060452531
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union.	2.300683946040348
I should like to have an answer to that question.	2.7268531263887152
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.	2.705719256128496
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union.	2.4761425391948033
In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks.	2.435907839193558
This too has not been solved.	3.9400788023974798
It is far too prescriptive.	3.3577837435706828
Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique.	1.929212903729312
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	2.717849230257446
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.	2.894632515671318
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	2.8047483992117357
Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon.	2.2732612687872513
During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course.	1.9578974657221047
My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me.	1.9068991850331904
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.	2.357562692301119
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.	2.387648264761081
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71.	2.2211519480690574
There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	2.5175625342163324
In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management.	2.373264155779332
What are the Council 's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	1.5889741253791767
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.	1.7519976145306715
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.	2.2805624701150062
It groups them together and that is very important.	3.459961854619494
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	1.9717587738349847
This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances.	2.4386612983501585
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	2.2302783887095683
In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them.	2.0814461867275726
It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there.	2.1179020130116344
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament ' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant.	2.619554344535698
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	2.6551155548433583
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for.	2.211027918642732
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion.	2.434998661146723
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted.	3.128378118665365
Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks.	1.5837136190132646
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	2.0932324389136596
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	3.460051299915345
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	2.0891302598450867
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	2.324322176687585
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	1.937448341543112
At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM.	1.8324850463403153
One example is water transfers.	2.0104758817494086
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides.	2.184858706297234
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	1.7543976674302637
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.	2.354338636439164
The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security.	2.4060715559039605
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission.	3.3575563102078743
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	2.6340415151834917
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	1.6243341635132922
If you ratify .	2.4924768764319736
Without them we would not be able to function.	3.2392020618515645
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	2.332825932506877
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.	2.1476650333990035
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	2.4646832952547237
We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.	2.2208990773175725
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	2.0720824070825663
We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead.	2.6410663688147715
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.	2.157815206074941
Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement.	2.3017595518127063
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries.	2.4475414592489315
A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short.	2.1627265716900776
A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation.	1.9904254446415117
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	1.729183884082008
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.	1.6313565524634013
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	2.3890536055262332
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	1.987013542169377
Who pays for the collection, the dismantling, the disposal and so on?	1.6395993409421805
Would it be possible for the EU to create a standardised inspection system that would also guarantee payment, out of Community funds, for the inspection of ships that fly a flag of convenience and cannot themselves pay the cost?	1.9304492516140508
Secondly, Cuba.	3.031243746613038
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	2.239899637263025
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	2.081499991662463
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow.	2.516362531823815
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.	1.8372931164996538
Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done.	1.5490683927789448
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato ' s report.	3.0938614766783643
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	2.139837467275601
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.	2.141714874612426
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.	1.3219726667090121
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	3.354027589696903
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	2.1646439698712245
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies.	2.0943549556259455
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.	2.3721395952748674
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	1.8562288507535079
Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men.	2.228972700208769
But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances, and flexibility in negotiations, that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history.	2.6074736092951456
In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted.	2.8066395831288653
I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect.	2.9904192136290253
The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly.	2.5462345233505346
All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected.	2.380019528877226
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.	1.6041585928720383
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	1.5643281370741053
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.	1.7870777421329311
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	1.927816740941772
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.	2.653384220919584
It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.	2.312951698961105
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.	2.6016473345747038
We await a proper response from the Russians.	2.7640768309617436
Furthermore, it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.	2.2899381003906267
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	2.0286184510379206
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.	2.680565102990277
This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve. Thirdly, the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment ' s priorities is an extremely positive step.	2.7082691642077217
In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas.	2.4144863269732877
The vote will be taken later this evening.	2.8232473330437906
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.	2.3225449539224385
In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency ' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust.	2.4525345335894664
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.	2.087182980337404
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments.	2.0772077734829666
A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year, may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years.	2.3730112758912605
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States ' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.	2.3533680996076862
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	2.7196023652188863
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	2.4981456416171985
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure, so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism.	2.17699172373192
I shall, however, mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers.	1.8742123345759463
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified.	2.4579610866677513
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	2.1556238328051296
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned.	2.314727116067175
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?	1.9734686988438532
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration.	2.2495842497148786
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	2.2829826558263844
In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland" [ "Reminiscing about Holland" ], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected.	1.588147665400963
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.	2.376841086957022
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.	1.8380140529006366
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	1.9767698894039496
From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.	2.3537095179946337
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission.	2.381171504675303
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today 's agenda.	2.9792456932869444
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.	2.140125804291768
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi 's programme.	2.3893656512831276
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?	2.0387497611260974
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	2.4931177374228186
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe.	2.2509097160554448
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.	2.2653246053577636
And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content.	3.0176676286956607
First and foremost, we need to compete in terms of quality.	3.149696027850774
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.	2.366386076824757
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food?	2.3521480732235536
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	1.5590415898120988
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.	1.6983915110311913
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament.	2.3131745223989513
Reforming the Commission	1.4054427692635314
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.	2.111430992576473
Certain isolated passages in the Commission ' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries.	2.178271319455392
Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements.	2.8966207350875908
I understand your concern about the rights of children.	3.394838393910709
I am aware of the Commission ' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	2.681062811115636
In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."	2.4072977597652105
Never mind that the Commission ' s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one "non-paper" , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards.	2.014160352688402
Everything else is wishful thinking.	1.510542289325679
These include, for example, costs and transfers.	2.287234987960502
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.	3.065561010916774
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.	2.976349727628327
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	2.438271201658151
The company ' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying.	2.478523666314481
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.	3.9337458192837476
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.	3.0256783721661082
Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?	3.096100664785044
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	2.103895558368737
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.	2.360877167264393
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	2.092107833194746
It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover ' activities, and the interception of telephone calls.	1.7421809824113164
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.	1.9671201911979004
It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions.	1.9112628477220623
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament.	2.787790742959434
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament.	2.7284151473205878
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	1.8975227115171336
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers.	1.4772167564161895
We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.	2.107528171542301
Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives.	1.6906346500077738
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	2.6996132437756
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.	2.8435811846128956
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	2.0141225709419457
Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.	1.796275820905257
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	1.7467429932680802
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.	2.4352309459192116
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well.	2.0294094571034824
Does it reflect this vision of coherence?	1.7885614263029352
It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism.	2.2132429308535233
The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	2.773511652713806
That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.	1.7621709653532962
However, I must again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher.	2.300903686624929
The Commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering, an eminently cross-pillar issue.	2.2767360395663716
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	2.774530608555883
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo 's motion.	2.2213187116559476
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	2.337099938573202
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.	2.6331116904211718
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.	1.918453377070048
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available.	3.4555671318020553
I hope that this building will then be occupied.	2.8059593111148087
But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual.	1.8493669088292561
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	2.4784011778548347
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	2.2902353805171645
. (DA) The Left ' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN.	2.1865423016546113
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012.	2.999373913029064
In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention.	2.02829635007981
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all.	2.2861498798566777
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.	2.7951814899207044
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	2.7428486501092335
In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.	2.246888253934937
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.	2.395680209372192
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.	1.9608055494549916
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President.	2.0328412174952883
We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.	2.465986863118121
The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission ' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances.	2.470627841813434
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	2.3422360454433004
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.	1.794322585820716
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.	1.7764411189051974
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about.	2.3724648386857337
This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia.	2.6880394942399226
This should first of all stand for better service.	2.9422186424608348
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	2.1760271941618976
The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns.	2.069426881277399
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.	1.9021714068223703
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	1.9119154274330858
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	2.792681643733045
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	2.09297399223821
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.	3.5095740262173285
There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.	1.731080998944714
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	2.216460009373612
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	2.760541960990816
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	2.18588442969033
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there.	2.403912330472742
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	2.2947693611098963
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing.	1.94487903563343
Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow.	2.037870034766194
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	2.7686673770722505
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	1.6193389106740759
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources.	2.9001656771565902
As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	2.160481429293122
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.	2.1972086506039195
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	2.2272494167724486
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact.	2.072787695226859
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	2.878165530545291
The European Commission ' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.	2.732358984273225
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny.	2.1068515745134757
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson.	2.4774128342169517
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed.	2.5992465367824114
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	1.8756789380785535
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading.	1.9701739765344333
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union	2.7809311635328244
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	2.4457101201570235
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	2.1739627997603197
I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein ' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council.	2.9920986029110606
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars.	2.4143811479137693
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties.	2.7801802999586425
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	2.834718842079103
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally ' s report, namely women ' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.	2.009354562203942
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.	1.9179008423962285
I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant.	2.2899761396253355
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	2.641789987186974
The Commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	2.6839939367147116
Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground.	2.378925930186108
On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions.	2.444728810506948
It is essential that we get the mix right.	2.6043374722058004
I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier.	2.262688222094706
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.	3.709011310093839
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.	2.9998422572271717
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.	1.6595273015673206
The latter element continues to be the Commission ' s fundamental objective, as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit, in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term.	2.694367542106529
Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission 's determination to make progress serves as a model.	2.118675502715438
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	2.250064116162485
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months.	2.6081267093151532
That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	1.9225714268155665
In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue.	2.0141582300571037
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	2.5940153416108815
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.	1.7447271435965503
I thought that it was quite superb.	3.8519218959550705
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.	1.9971038561805385
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	2.4218837827303115
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished.	1.9035482184566532
What is the Commissioner ' s opinion of this?	2.377796852529181
In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended.	2.5376060743480564
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue.	2.5429425866923885
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	1.868477037120612
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	2.0194580682344148
Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.	2.506916874623765
In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.	2.724733031789257
For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation.	1.847716542518974
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom.	1.8794936313957513
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	1.768430153617072
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?	1.819847643969514
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	2.2969804049457725
The European Union voted against that motion.	2.6730005716168344
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today.	2.8632231496767035
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	1.9068287052017123
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	2.357909358465832
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	2.2210067139673337
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	2.7500520905993455
And there is no sign of this trend ' s being reversed.	2.6503871759066406
There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines.	2.778883978295975
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	3.084921778535051
Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam.	1.9084770693707682
Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked.	2.2957408070071237
The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these.	2.712011603242677
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider ' s party.	2.5532838895507166
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.	2.4939384650968868
Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.	2.4686745424834187
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.	2.2803771248651974
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics.	2.699464610760688
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.	1.9759953484562465
Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance.	1.61232541972165
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests.	2.7622400750846094
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.	2.420117949875677
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	2.5549116888844314
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.	3.3666579174855524
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?	1.9518810642218345
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship.	2.2292401329567335
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products.	2.5120473996971775
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	2.5495024858580213
I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada.	1.7823450382312127
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit.	2.1004533599924566
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now.	2.8249735202777075
I do not understand why the power centres of Europe are keeping quiet, letting things pass and, by working with the Russians as if nothing were amiss, giving its support to the government which is waging this war.	2.0383096479120693
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.	1.7754968130732238
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	3.0630375866695956
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	2.423406027086208
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen.	2.283242376125164
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"	2.297934574665252
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney ' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	2.2096489036516935
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo 's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies?	2.387216336369134
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	2.4205535275823067
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.	3.0181859557692614
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU.	1.756007488864566
Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on.	1.9049764101043964
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	2.0025097091397552
Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher ' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.	2.6391876054624324
However, nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it.	2.454329235913085
This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.	2.6514185040362044
- (SV) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing, to say the least.	1.821740720870388
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers ' clutches is the cost of transport.	2.253653913688452
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span.	2.342320590674751
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision.	2.6719605901558188
Mr President, the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union.	2.0531757728293796
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	1.6807795241971748
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):	1.7808731702205087
Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive.	3.0123178314408183
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	2.2410610894322742
So the honourable Member 's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.	2.21060854074199
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	1.830444418392112
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me.	2.3393007962245633
Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister.	1.825844070158713
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.	1.9411424776137458
These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.	1.916155303637842
	1.0510108151299706
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid.	2.9736663382171677
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	2.14164854254505
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	2.1811760873541717
And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	1.9873777455426076
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility.	3.3992764161981937
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.	1.9394171703713599
In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.	1.8318476775470165
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	3.2940465032621393
So this issue will be addressed.	2.3630322440857308
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	1.7930198243398463
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	2.9940230343594236
In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.	2.116047613094405
.	1.374839594702952
However, I would like to insist on certain points.	2.5909145715050386
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	2.6402018333969006
The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council.	2.6441877199203296
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda, there are already four items.	2.023621342833443
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process.	2.884653198951086
You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come.	2.0781058579059923
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	2.2062210510844182
So let us contact the United States now!	2.716425685569905
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	1.9062550164137535
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction.	2.319649934406051
The Commission ' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.	2.042832585665065
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense.	2.962058953458254
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	2.4309129360099284
My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development.	2.1976788192657724
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward.	2.629548255175487
Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective.	2.0274217647371637
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	1.9933653198104913
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	2.616386367112536
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.	2.326710832253462
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	3.052752271234882
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	3.061792528924967
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.	2.648040215481068
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.	2.658900761376307
Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda.	2.7163531062208173
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite!	2.753282115472359
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	2.0423094395417927
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie ' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.	2.306446834332039
The postal service is also the bus service.	3.018278589353606
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	2.28424131357198
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	1.9438323400417234
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	3.765024489551998
Welcome	1.0963477464416975
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.	1.881810685669128
It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions.	2.2910894599991742
I refer to Cuba ' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.	2.3703490790588844
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	2.119035714041084
There is now a new Commission.	2.4933092162931536
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?	2.5893933207265443
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.	2.4075506242910323
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	2.4875280614108077
Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together.	2.1466247244966943
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.	2.469402349327729
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	2.502727148358682
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	1.7895105662903599
This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun.	1.8944722929972115
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote.	2.3899156484965647
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession.	2.219965696902697
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission.	2.650042812801334
The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless.	2.7890341284726663
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing.	2.589469026618043
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era.	3.0300263924222186
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	2.4542567479173734
However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme ' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision.	2.254664894668279
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	1.7141048509924728
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.	2.5779373844786364
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework.	2.4781250712552176
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	2.1434289996289824
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	2.805910486275623
In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.	2.5752886792086267
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union ' s regional policy in general.	2.1994800017611853
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	2.047863020250292
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.	2.153881049340281
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?	1.7379525398148543
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.	2.240861888030729
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do?	2.103412403469615
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	2.2561330772770902
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs?	2.5029151531805276
But we have to grasp the tools to do that.	2.691843361953388
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	2.6200875694548422
Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known.	3.01008413328012
Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent.	1.9770725853720057
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	2.6241464238938317
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.	3.3160208622475227
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	2.38915319579826
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	2.2406570541308604
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	2.1521634927614124
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999.	2.3848357657847483
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.	2.020545116607136
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	3.064624790327253
I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus.	2.5139947757892025
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS)	1.8001870840769454
A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically.	2.5901310925688854
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	2.226842380663181
The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999.	2.0677648883482176
As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods.	2.315919308516934
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium.	1.7102477320797942
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.	3.439138441853988
No-one would benefit from this situation.	1.4556171423414108
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.	2.972179814089474
However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute.	2.263010314036108
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.	2.1009000479122055
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values.	2.0420117861810847
I endorse this view.	3.9375351775659286
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless.	2.95534320820435
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.	2.826457825386054
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	1.9583630833315562
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra.	2.3044162451223404
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)	1.3539675252128425
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	2.1681475125515393
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.	2.585390307874414
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country.	2.386008325523329
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies.	1.9081096247574352
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.	1.7177114017952622
The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.	2.5381554256236982
Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000):	1.3061568502723453
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	2.5842333227052046
As Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic, social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries.	2.3646945575629466
However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.	2.6559565764773327
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004.	3.576943521849006
Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes ' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent.	2.157351202815181
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.	2.4282892906043307
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	2.132974587492067
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	2.041745479920293
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	2.055068463039535
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.	2.2531236627374485
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.	2.033712487390425
It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage.	2.7001328764831865
Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations.	2.51213360763791
Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe ' s water policy for the next three decades.	2.2653574598885515
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally ' s report.	2.1509382473270393
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	2.27307809325453
Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.	2.4538632451666547
But opinion differs as to the solution.	2.791971275960104
But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action.	1.8061023021600238
I think this proposal is a good one.	3.747294395423392
For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services.	2.391611960807929
This brings me to the content of the report.	2.4639690783991846
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	2.500933246605532
But unfortunately, as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber, human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world.	2.2116187012849866
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	2.4467697175197762
Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	1.7278131230207958
Mr President, in a world such as this, which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic field, our responses, in order to be effective, must be concerted and coordinated.	2.453682766549473
It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson ' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission.	2.2904197591907813
Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize.	2.3370126320181717
The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market.	2.3650097626721647
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	1.843274898244498
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	2.3571035797873643
In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation.	2.393346718693966
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card ' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	2.1245139143967284
Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment.	1.716401509047522
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.	1.543297815699492
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.	2.1565957287743482
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.	2.096620836651817
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration.	3.667300205044553
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point. This was just a procedural motion.	2.336686806634694
Mr President, Mr Katiforis ' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report.	2.055978715725638
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	2.993908299592442
Are there any comments?	1.2644728256185398
Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development.	2.3216916015784252
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	2.512843604418679
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.	2.3562474407156677
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development.	2.4405528385596313
In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon.	1.9081630475330127
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them.	2.246480321891877
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations.	2.094203634919521
Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.	2.0683880097433893
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).	1.5940285870585136
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned.	1.88130901447781
(The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.)	1.5540944303769562
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.	2.4206284647418386
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.	2.487210566325085
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur.	2.7807093844361903
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	2.5483733996964473
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.	3.379207293141673
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets, because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably.	1.872994424945494
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented.	2.082934138877001
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue.	2.2728453423812063
Women in the decision-making process	2.5654431303536334
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	2.3141603401378146
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe, tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union ' s regions.	2.7760286131785823
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	2.4910419711227902
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform.	2.9291454312179375
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3647183468043427
But there is an art to that as well.	2.3032837230164622
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	1.9104881569854837
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management.	2.6225635529626175
We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument.	2.9455265082106576
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	2.0512796720539948
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation?	1.7477690956670522
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	2.0041923579241185
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.	2.4128953302093232
At the Commission 's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded.	2.1094796717804325
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.	1.9511929571243918
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	2.3543625040897034
Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market.	1.9154534176221192
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.	2.5579713326764355
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency.	1.8848623006888119
The Commission ' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS, that is to say management companies.	2.5644721526835785
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	2.232873841901416
Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday ' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	2.4699197064470177
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians.	2.604269357155535
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is.	1.4732877456439792
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	1.83418995706912
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.	2.4664016971409377
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work.	1.873855019054326
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	1.92235233238412
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.	2.1766019229142417
Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance.	3.097170298741439
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	2.680633236251748
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.	2.200710597258738
However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.	2.225651412890513
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020.	2.1864581990338445
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission.	3.741289130141641
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	2.3242817269251064
First Part	2.586079996946247
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	2.4027500973086786
We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe ' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide.	2.1259986065721304
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue.	2.0780900250971106
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy.	2.768405412350379
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well.	3.0814886591203123
The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention.	2.3369766121025246
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.	2.055913806931126
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.	2.08259100208661
Mr President, what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today: an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals?	2.3090867689677754
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union, recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base, with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access, on equal terms, and in which our citizens can have real confidence.	2.3176436631440445
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%.	1.9981150291092287
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.	1.914411611841201
Thank you, Mr Davies.	2.143733076686093
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.	2.4546042211777457
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	2.5487593917337668
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.	2.317134670917926
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	2.443412325448173
If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past.	2.6231500720544823
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach.	2.3936922204173356
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	2.0433514973778997
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation.	2.1309086436762703
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.	2.3703239344143854
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement. We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament.	2.405403330262654
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region ' s multi-ethnic nature.	2.3367922055473733
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented.	4.535607744651623
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal, and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week.	2.349705564860701
BSE has certainly not gone away.	1.4739730421340609
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur ' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	2.633750871407021
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development.	2.9325619507784224
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.	2.4551065550042512
The Commission?	5.686125255587676
The Commission ' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union.	2.6244426675207935
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	1.866326365863396
This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional.	2.229077913928929
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.	2.4200560997216547
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria, and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens.	2.708641777953352
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed.	1.7720261943620779
In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work.	2.270020674811385
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version.	2.332541563903636
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	2.524406937742584
In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched.	2.105357062198819
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	1.8904686343538482
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.	2.3728730737997603
Quite the opposite, it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded.	2.209871492226585
Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health.	1.800983319389567
I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values.	2.1467760583936375
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	2.339227699437173
Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion.	2.924039319928471
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems.	2.5541594107043806
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.	2.245458336234384
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.	2.5962608363679442
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high.	2.482987676600996
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States ' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	2.563126080223672
B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance	1.8013290911185942
The Commission ' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument.	3.1087297488105263
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.	2.59320800859428
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	2.325099787431224
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	2.1266479156230775
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation.	2.4229522833304977
You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	2.5162813568655733
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States ' parliaments.	2.4352317763818965
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	2.005476315158749
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	1.7217725589983477
The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament ' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers ' liability.	2.103666016315699
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.	2.6372140010111127
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	2.8540569661839394
. (FR) Mr Decourrière ' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.	2.4761029544884994
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.	2.0049095757398923
As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study.	2.7656255006397457
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.	1.7823735712939772
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld ' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	2.02175603947579
There must also be savings.	3.2544114612205046
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits.	2.1588205759474945
However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted.	2.5513296633268765
A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.	2.5975028831210176
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.	3.311973477641783
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource.	1.4582612919038318
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol.	2.93627789267647
With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court ' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union ' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits.	2.3673894515664484
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.	2.1481606057895295
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	2.622317337257202
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.	3.144650831893341
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	2.18610212425567
But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes.	2.197206673978257
In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak.	1.8594228566027022
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	2.5185680826505545
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.	2.2478222842562707
But is there not more to it than that?	2.2285636206493473
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates.	2.0152582317625845
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.	2.653089254029048
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements.	2.4253698781363804
That is not the route that has been taken.	3.0002270911696876
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.	2.522940045801815
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support.	2.191327231872938
Take the trade agreements.	1.5746040745030077
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	2.4086460404522896
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?	2.3677327241370785
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union ' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community ' s economic life.	2.3967054371922205
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure.	2.4539672570503552
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.457652188634284
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far.	2.3262993148601785
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel.	2.620051687240655
For example, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects ' - this is an obvious issue.	1.995404174630088
Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union.	1.6475697523820856
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.	2.3682073279127303
The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency ' s statement of 1 February 2000.	2.43135544625989
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally ' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women ' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus.	2.619661751947379
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone.	2.083948849655031
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.	1.7876457473473537
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	2.347962117847335
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	2.769457812520211
As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.	2.472252920857815
That concludes Question Time.	2.205777470426928
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.	1.7324038396803638
However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.	2.2056986928452873
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement.	2.6530139735520284
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name.	2.466905947056552
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.	1.8422562462509469
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.	2.3686957335320518
There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources.	2.274355110093179
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?	2.0854089992393186
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	2.4948935852335246
From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance.	1.9718111996778698
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	1.875741482986364
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	2.2003448176233493
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.	2.165783154419252
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.	1.9234605711580797
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations.	1.8166368360642495
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001.	2.8382681526703952
It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring.	2.2361904252906486
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	2.0626902045822226
In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area.	3.018997384258956
It also, of course, finds indirect expression in the question.	2.2743186881061614
At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.	2.3975616554523853
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	2.625953653060307
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	2.282383463515992
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe ' s meagre resources.	1.7243686579011552
This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes.	2.24009808739777
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	1.9175626995932538
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	2.5549505262117367
Are we doing enough?	1.973273401760487
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.	2.5730057802024384
It is essential to establish a single European system, but one based on fairness, full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions, including an end to routine detention.	2.386861099998137
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality: water will be the main resource at stake in years to come, starting tomorrow.	1.9491174799898034
Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin.	2.3973454885211614
If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.	2.6557096273408933
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.	3.0842051097131233
They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters.	1.6982136628194962
Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.	1.7071736737379495
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.	2.0351109467637736
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	2.243857908589555
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	2.4737656483874773
I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life.	1.8530150274222095
First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers.	1.9510684584031273
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	2.7761017381730184
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	2.1143484997483464
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report.	3.012097704051498
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	3.000646518707488
Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had.	2.0040674404498344
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" .	2.2067985508270658
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency.	2.0575158665242648
In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives.	2.052679022059902
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	2.378287831033237
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.	2.5952965830255392
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.	2.2673890634908935
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance.	2.1698727619978295
Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself.	2.9302560420994097
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	1.8328163369400827
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues.	1.92938731050012
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States.	2.477170711147995
Securing this is a major priority.	2.446206858805563
Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer?	1.614060901564691
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.184851740693806
Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.	1.958002259230794
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	1.7513607595679344
My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.	2.8313431870864902
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	1.6570476146648472
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	2.8390351746528584
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project, which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire, to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex.	1.5405837119588637
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.	2.0517331389868203
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	2.148453688425021
Declarations of principle are not enough.	1.2883995247323572
We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector.	2.4886323830312618
I am not going to say much more on these issues.	2.4936749274257646
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	2.408716206085712
It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on.	1.9555536905398372
The problem has been overcome.	3.488734599295481
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.	1.9289226333010112
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance.	2.3833582559486786
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you.	2.138070876972522
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.	2.530083961779231
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project.	1.7957902523391058
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.	2.532907774665686
We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character.	1.7256593992626608
. (EL) The EU ' s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in the form of a joint agreement as established by Article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that Balkan republic.	2.3024503505335527
Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno ' .	1.447006033352977
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.	1.686692453510076
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	2.2040693674868623
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	2.4469276356485024
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	1.6410948657201447
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	2.1839114289836896
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	2.0464983351498005
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.	3.03282181024058
If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.	2.388478229441508
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	1.9334832960410904
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.	2.4950875114667337
The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing.	2.6633860457191543
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.	3.007722141830887
But for pity ' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	2.0395295790348267
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission ' s offices for several months.	2.2498896083801383
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project.	2.4414494262292896
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	2.551918300166425
For the reasons set out above, I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax.	2.023386519249928
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.	2.4484125975212163
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	2.2648157491395646
We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast.	2.199482239449381
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	1.6803203829151183
So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease.	2.431078015663258
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	1.963446102867439
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism, so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age.	2.587529107495401
You are lucky that Mr Böge ' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so.	2.2465761987036954
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.	1.7808130738100236
It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.	2.55396326038898
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.	2.089668881479424
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union ' s disputes resolution procedures.	2.282425780527523
As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies.	2.471843609437249
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.	2.8078189269218616
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	2.2720981546713426
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere.	2.34098345649098
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	2.306939124752863
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.	1.488562085491354
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.	2.1334262110426705
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.	2.6078867197314386
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	2.618638021756583
Cambodia	1.3592135529195646
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	2.254784296834268
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	2.8439799344087264
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	2.8460949953884698
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).	2.33605801710173
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	2.4116928437676517
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	1.9244550321520608
Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement.	1.73641319892867
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.	2.2136134873527165
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	2.6270643937513394
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	1.650181919487264
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	2.209232939956399
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage.	2.3146694882076626
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	2.8040398925075998
We back the rapporteur ' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	2.161307634634113
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account.	1.9605486565265333
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.	2.421066394817487
There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner.	2.484840598693129
For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission.	2.129833510277413
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.	1.458821546762112
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	2.709567415916109
People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved.	1.7666164607250334
Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	2.0182639878485884
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	2.1687207769541903
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Having set it up, I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust.	1.974298483236677
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided.	2.390597778000604
Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs.	1.5232822182508903
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)	1.9192698450667272
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	2.7416795115772916
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero?	1.8679415071348935
I welcome Parliament 's support for that.	2.8754111148303476
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament.	2.4383895401065367
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	2.701947065849339
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail.	2.426508413717075
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	2.578431955861312
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised.	2.305876964433637
I do not agree.	3.4961554096620846
(Parliament approved the request)	1.940639846427481
Bearing this in mind, I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter.	1.6667766003673985
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	2.8300491874110016
Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas.	2.063441263314028
At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	1.8352891151748032
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected.	2.2350672281909003
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	2.860534626921082
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.	2.4046708812265685
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	2.191939077317497
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	2.6151506413133454
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people.	2.2065448370038627
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and we believe that on the basis of work already done, it will be possible, at least in the field of seizure of assets, for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.	2.6998809400484807
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.	2.0282670165458816
This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy.	2.074060431992621
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?	1.9570014199122212
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	1.7180235431307025
Nothing could be further from the truth!	1.6914272609356602
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.	1.8205876454646421
In the past the British Conservatives ' double standards have brought the United Kingdom ' s House of Commons into disrepute, and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament.	2.3311532592741546
My group 's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group 's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	2.1039836624467028
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	2.007451213798828
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	1.8247098535402186
One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context.	2.29270094718231
I saw some of Mr Kinnock 's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	2.213986179929289
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	2.4928195739508605
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.	2.116686202139696
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision.	2.1315637862249726
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	2.3102875990579896
To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle.	2.3289059166095676
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism ' and 'superstate ' are not mentioned at all.	2.044038778250297
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	1.8611365724165752
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	1.7262574562151745
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective.	3.6732708286458844
Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency.	2.633868157701481
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because, by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU, their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition, they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways.	1.7345310539358607
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	1.9090181515607143
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni.	2.4519143624441013
In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.	2.201777686687993
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	2.7281485624805604
No human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today, the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, and in educational institutions, to mention but a few.	1.966219374518331
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	2.684690556842911
We do not know what is happening.	2.6499239068622216
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	2.3985362865657236
Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe.	2.6649560544668067
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?	2.165475931726946
I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste.	3.3607943624657333
As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes.	2.1146948963976655
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	2.217463130730784
However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries.	2.602634778389254
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties.	2.4939685154240765
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	2.063971858718588
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.	1.9529149344077825
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world ' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher.	2.133906830786572
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	2.1052519789559665
In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.	2.014820887759179
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law.	2.845417334496143
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.	2.8048223992791828
Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council ' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions.	2.2552851106808527
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.	2.7321324552994017
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France ' s at 10%.	2.074614114886869
In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.	2.589962154458387
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment.	1.964626514429639
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.	3.2262644392159006
A single key is to suffice in future.	2.081408421222757
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	2.407594568953173
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	2.274065950606397
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	2.289475175607676
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms.	2.6567239422129205
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.	3.109819318352858
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.	4.228786345489065
Additives in feedingstuffs	1.4092363023587458
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.	2.2584380545446323
Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment.	1.975557031741102
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.	1.8915582743519987
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water?	2.239223443350752
I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.	2.8814827976558117
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	2.6349349546156344
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.	1.7216868744549456
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive?	2.646645170811979
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998.	2.539329708795933
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People 's Party or does the Austrian People 's Party continue to sit in that political group?	1.8874917837902594
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	2.595403529877524
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	2.754973895015449
However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.	2.9404590079187454
But all is not lost.	2.6736615927206238
Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government.	2.118506854977719
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context.	2.3333752049998093
It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor.	1.9595240126711624
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	2.0296673381909462
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	1.9214892604224232
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	1.7611367463567302
Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.	2.461616707280362
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	2.470099457151699
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	1.9310031608566365
I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change.	1.9796777581289873
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission 's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	2.7212125955776845
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	2.2163666074464667
If certain countries wish to use the words "former Yugoslavia" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them.	1.9724476982652797
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution.	2.540403751100264
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	2.0463611402796875
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States ' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.	2.5860374485545927
I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions.	2.6343124674198073
In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	2.22016265091439
This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States.	2.4801523924149014
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.	2.7600202435060566
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	2.213722714136791
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	2.705705666381566
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	2.579194158530763
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	1.5722230962181276
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	2.498410358621875
For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco.	2.2191943738626367
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	2.2271558359174826
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women ' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women ' s Day.	1.9881864047993023
Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise?	2.6603989802620234
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	2.440106774690167
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.	2.1049341803766444
Many thanks for this.	1.953637945098492
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	1.864458559884071
Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.	2.780795228728042
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998.	3.2796039375242585
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	2.3295497814692236
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	2.0887066728222705
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you.	2.241122492892572
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children.	1.6300428196460364
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	2.3262179699355863
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	2.810502132307172
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering ' s lack of logic.	2.0086831650544483
Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment.	1.7082652843990576
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission ' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.	2.3240786725509874
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	2.0667547726285544
In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns.	2.2892469207143926
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences.	2.0441494892157923
You may answer the question.	2.255861159583208
For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin.	2.337561032188985
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.	2.0842114603866095
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.	2.761667278088901
Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading.	2.552907583746932
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	2.4362467128460548
(PT) The Commission ' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.	2.311898738584236
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.220838150672267
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	2.2872467717531255
Can you please do something about it?	2.0193177106221825
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission ' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?	3.1240280959723705
Everything that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account.	2.8366286999095185
In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage.	2.1978379722387547
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	2.4844796793317165
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	1.7298176683872788
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.	2.238584322686403
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	2.221316238299161
Corrie report (A5-0032/2000)	1.3865133772789289
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism.	1.875882075327478
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.	2.568381426473962
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today.	3.0701577535897933
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament ' s opinion next month.	3.049352444138239
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments.	1.8496349008925186
You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission ' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	1.953551212958298
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	2.766624190682648
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this.	2.656274332694616
In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation.	2.2887475800955444
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	2.7041547116300104
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union ' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	2.3175720061735565
I accept that Mr Andersson 's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU.	2.0891836233739993
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	1.4608317045598298
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.	2.8728578389972848
They would then determine their own prices.	2.2672674560506416
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.	1.7611205039215634
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.	2.503145399185609
I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work.	2.2075677755787835
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired.	2.020170368724255
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed.	2.6737716780310086
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.	1.898894904677364
.	1.374839594702952
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.	2.883486529980019
I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty.	2.124866424027136
The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.	1.9347147201284323
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season.	1.9253728023956762
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	3.3721995986670414
However, I would like to concentrate on two points.	2.8659241468127385
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.	2.0719869897244796
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	2.5901793812292437
That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community ' s Habitats Directive.	2.5993515565229512
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	2.592098394020341
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes.	2.9269723170638304
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press.	2.0204601420665984
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.	3.2897022716784354
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt ' s report brings us.	3.1385410512041783
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.	3.398731227741088
Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time.	2.3604363255017407
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	2.1752279416087053
I believe that in this context, and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust, it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.	3.462052125878136
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.	2.0603270457110723
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	2.2955425999341443
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	2.2347696012671046
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	2.056128316089463
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result.	2.1301598292688375
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.	2.89644288129986
Lastly, I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area, as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground.	2.21547913371516
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.	2.698248452165839
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.	2.12036667787663
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction.	2.6691057793408746
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):	1.817987938730927
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.	2.33668362210139
First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided.	2.1056685152886305
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm.	2.272551104458095
However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus.	3.413454882882903
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission ' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	2.0988520702517617
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal.	2.5309765733830667
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very meagre opening offer.	3.225974169646864
With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy.	2.124990737813288
There are reputable companies too.	2.4038832294683727
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause.	2.4969500937844713
Madam President, my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission ' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate, instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary.	2.2992774106832385
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	2.0287408046809916
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	2.2198594124215862
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings.	2.070579199510855
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.	2.33479918247249
I would particularly draw my colleagues ' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men.	2.1637318701365427
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda ' s work as rapporteur.	2.3951879460969536
We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.	2.177663585821134
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals.	3.3901906560003177
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	4.003811986336117
Lastly then, Europol, which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments, with which Parliament is familiar, to make Europol ' s operations viable but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain, and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol ' s powers and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.	1.9771048121287322
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.	2.0569326782800754
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English.	1.9310727143329964
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.	2.33980996303627
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.	1.8967798155905031
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	2.3939122379042863
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	2.727717804411791
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.	2.4483560065002665
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations.	2.307144947575973
As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded.	2.5299149897226303
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.	2.5845346117767285
The correct speculative approach, it seems to me, is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos, rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets.	2.005209971662165
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market.	2.330911625243208
We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people.	2.255362518439702
It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.	2.6106503995292343
At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat.	1.7672170069565662
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	2.1200614150964308
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	2.7255368607028494
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year.	2.3874438078871756
The second point relates to Syria.	2.719646310749334
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	3.6021257622928453
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.	2.6123010763528987
In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable.	3.066744288544927
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	1.9955539943171405
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it.	3.3023517455661917
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.	2.429974060056355
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration.	2.4416895147996405
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility.	2.366772554302417
, rapporteur.	1.429286798015651
May he rest in peace.	1.737303303594296
My group is fully intent on helping with this work.	1.837627732609814
Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission ' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses.	2.1975861281697466
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries.	2.257632389578627
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	2.177785133394584
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty.	2.7385658410132274
It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle.	2.3703860862924198
In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded.	2.5953434733251504
It is now February and we are still waiting.	3.428111754396888
They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation.	2.4358075886549737
Mr President, the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater, drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation.	3.1757221798637847
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	2.8827567133249112
In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale.	2.1705457916436344
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	3.300770100764895
.	1.374839594702952
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.	2.247534525507298
On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent.	2.4278236885688824
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	1.9937183140297907
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.	1.6001680109012906
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue.	2.3955830825358864
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.	2.659562461773492
But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses.	2.164425877046209
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law.	2.966242682183342
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	2.6960664290668874
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities.	2.708411389769604
As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future.	2.0032472638213394
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.	3.2681177702290247
The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN ' s Security Council.	2.3510594855635056
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.	2.4714542413097504
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	1.8664116929598316
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	1.8499887838343694
In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union.	2.0482093772346994
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	2.2486019953255765
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.	2.2321216048198673
Action simply has not been taken.	2.0358292636031
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly.	2.2598941641638532
This is part of the solution.	3.8917380916554625
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	2.122780615856042
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.	2.3318400043597602
Firstly, Mr President, although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency, it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction.	2.1801455201821556
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.	2.0096383804200313
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	1.8918601349561492
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	2.277017361969
We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey.	2.6009198385528682
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right.	2.88893869483863
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.	2.2705768403806745
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.	1.9004256473835406
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.	2.4337713879084055
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.	2.70587123979272
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.	2.4160679638704337
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks?	1.7424310860566241
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	2.2374983418885823
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.	3.580886410959408
Once the project comes to an end after five years, the policy of free gifts also ends.	1.990832265149036
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.	1.9745600297341566
It would be Europe ' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.	2.5489115186282945
It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality.	2.3862126684879583
However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security.	3.0998999249115093
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	1.9825769592310318
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.	2.132385765094395
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	2.785441878826353
It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being.	2.1031473551630406
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.	2.4979588263708794
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	2.600073621207044
I will tell you a few things we should do.	2.7712639466232973
These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level.	1.9712176361659695
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	2.3619476067354888
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen ' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared.	1.7224495278121759
As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public.	2.1153351087639143
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	2.2315753847340165
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context.	3.0610504016293767
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	3.0963851762201915
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	2.3368529538720324
However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.	2.3530657191280184
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	2.0806371047407057
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy.	2.31097707523614
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.	2.391930454650212
We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives.	1.6222553673632973
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.	2.3308173222713835
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?	1.982109308820089
In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant.	2.6657209450871493
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women.	2.1694806563442
After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment?	2.0367337512076236
Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities.	1.851678849147383
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	2.100488915714245
All those things come together.	2.12788827575161
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	2.721726238084296
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects.	2.6091608296644933
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.	2.368633467805265
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	1.8275157760719614
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	2.7420640424509504
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	2.8102573883964155
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	1.4331617992240682
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning.	2.181937920478688
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	2.277183641072137
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	2.026042690894275
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man ' s activities.	1.9278822063297896
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report.	2.392931644681226
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress.	2.9524565827107896
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	2.318653089241823
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	1.988710593621541
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	2.847235122275016
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	2.0449479703231863
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.	2.9779628525268937
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister ' s treasury funds.	2.339819699868743
It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it.	2.5362486559048563
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	2.4210717933114747
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.	1.563533416577695
However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves.	2.544181140992741
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.	2.211975668231009
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved.	1.8739512445507087
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe.	2.7716846352756366
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	1.9449168890337378
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.	2.4508078841017555
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.	2.34052171873819
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	1.8815733168732018
In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.	1.864725457335153
Mr President, this morning ' s debate is very important.	2.6298348201827437
Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter.	2.2859397154812964
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	2.0148013254060015
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	2.780522144201089
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003.	2.2589709166910366
Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking.	2.0039401529260297
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.	2.3863274014196034
Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas.	1.785046439016927
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	2.411717310075682
At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.	2.4106560507441332
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.	1.8784942301917065
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	2.1124784073273686
I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions.	2.9346242951421577
That appeared in the communication published last July.	2.4920207492249036
Unfortunately, this is not true of them all, but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report.	3.0519084931538045
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	2.80728578063915
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone.	2.1635175371246995
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	2.0961687096637345
Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States.	2.8710616545795116
This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU.	3.1691170092792027
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	1.9629236930647171
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you.	1.6364365005201578
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force.	1.8514718498151967
The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies.	2.3778490319577683
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	1.8821879161397754
We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky ' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights.	2.297524782221762
SAVE	1.552275500991075
It was erroneously included in today ' s agenda.	2.9379749037165483
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	2.5204137402584914
I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other.	1.9248234149255645
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	2.520378517438071
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	2.318588836673536
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.	2.3555983391523507
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	2.273615956928198
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	2.277849339248558
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?	2.1387016922998927
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.	2.3783105086806957
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.	2.900034406909287
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.	2.9928429527572167
In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance.	2.243542477636811
By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000" are superb.	2.4916336407540203
I also hope that, if there is any life in outer space, as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn, it was tuned in to Mr Havel ' s speech as well.	2.2406928196259153
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	1.616821361507948
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned.	2.8164994839340967
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	2.413349278765635
Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market.	2.3466038153103774
I would like to explain our thinking here.	2.74399982173678
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	2.2582484458486247
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result.	2.1224412728211313
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	3.0546446779871954
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	1.8733537290333475
First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.	2.7359801185821833
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues.	2.968490105728676
My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility.	1.8105643169059384
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	2.4885183579413597
Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff.	2.4957801342711003
Furthermore, I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, that is to say the Office in Alicante, to comment further on this new question and I can, as a result, inform the honourable Member as follows, on behalf of the Office:	2.2081009347857106
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	1.7148835549493606
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	2.5849650400396222
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	1.9079686008755612
However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling.	1.9414699993446156
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	2.1214607333775644
However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business.	2.3367228200247716
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	2.4252822393170055
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	2.2253956553947
I can understand your concern.	3.2688998509964144
In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage.	2.5601779934593516
Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject.	1.8784965592357146
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	2.288013811066699
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	2.2097431425654586
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.	1.8924658077839718
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	1.8338549821167507
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system.	2.5342349421250416
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view.	1.9236434748057527
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.745750118902646
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.	2.399941560371191
However, the main concern remains .	2.3612206370228126
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back.	1.507617531015503
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	2.7515650199635164
Cuba ' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle.	1.8173671861212304
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone ' s reach in society.	1.6716669151062993
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.	2.598754836095252
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	2.4849717801418945
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	2.149719527704972
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.	2.2500475913539026
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.	2.11333845513045
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	2.236712997349876
Underground networks?	1.2535877321600513
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.	1.7771688902194578
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations ' capacity to cause damage.	1.9781269414817102
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.	2.4270624666738443
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	2.416483024007644
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel ' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives.	2.8019795060212807
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	2.283498658850747
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.	1.748287271566305
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse.	2.087406431363354
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	2.2376323452441382
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
Colleagues, you know the rules.	1.5047057200897007
I also want to mention the death penalty.	2.7674119908745465
Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions.	2.0960481789858103
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.	1.9629076231450848
Why do I say that culture is important?	2.487955184369021
ALTENER	1.5570054654420609
We must not waiver in that commitment.	2.5688515334295157
These are two of Vice-President Marinho ' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.9189067545268896
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	2.429557732958256
In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe ' s voice is important.	2.449257387639518
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	1.5746245112564319
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform.	2.3529068128591124
One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe.	2.606954930069189
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement, and this relates to Turkey ' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession.	2.2590873758642127
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.	2.5344170448350516
In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	2.1880033272943766
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	2.158653917270099
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.	3.1953708846392566
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness.	1.9061823956991448
Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage.	2.076893375398414
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.	2.5358313898621363
In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.	2.4640450560791547
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit.	1.8599968890430096
The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension.	2.3116337173567088
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	1.9321727408725826
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.	1.902789678643234
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.	2.367697168158305
In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned.	2.519477221356645
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.	2.7495002275044667
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	2.376603217645472
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	3.1840695507141294
Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis.	2.423927160391157
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.	2.1170583422871925
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	1.7118898372883555
Have you already included your second term of office?	1.6045352869150298
(Applause from the PSE Group)	1.2204981788506526
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.	2.5588202785640894
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.	2.6622025465432446
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.	2.041287383044753
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman ' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	2.311697658131061
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament.	2.4768768821471046
As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position.	2.3871840469131604
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	2.8185049918867406
Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya.	3.2443725495222147
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	2.3232548077021313
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.	2.2228587071565657
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	2.026427905226583
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	2.3127944584828612
Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1. ' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council?	2.1392458891622246
I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination.	2.599581080396628
I just have one more request.	3.171559719784623
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today ' s decision makers.	2.636861877482189
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.	2.039565795205802
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!	2.8252122904317356
Mr President, we take note that the excuse-making, reticent Presidency, which, in recent months, has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today, has come to an end.	2.4379435875897655
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time.	2.259657666492508
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region 's very scarce water resources.	2.4236116241131302
The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR.	2.381005663246222
. (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme.	2.769441092231936
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees.	1.7424480620441587
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model.	2.048449858726329
Most of Parliament ' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious.	2.2117989294832947
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.	2.2640864110675882
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	2.412954066761018
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago, the difference between then and now is like that between night and day, despite difficulties and delays.	1.990399966093946
Statement by the President	1.7753971629875311
I can only fully share your concern.	2.757611344765753
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.	2.600745103847303
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting.	3.1338211008592136
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	2.534079039839828
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars.	2.09449741919733
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.	2.3847867202921504
Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework.	2.4678772408442105
We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.	1.9111515568400805
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	1.7211734540927215
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	2.538377591526172
In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	2.491239757849619
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	2.473816813692139
Are there any comments?	1.2644728256185398
It is therefore political by nature.	2.625341060595431
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years.	2.065594225400482
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	2.2054970136512484
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology.	2.848219097444897
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region.	2.400506476335489
In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS.	2.275561774597116
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission 's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.	3.518303600401973
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.	1.6555860734147043
The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.	2.2434020497099096
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	2.6682742606588894
A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative.	1.9644114031696427
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.	2.565467784818231
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year.	2.005584518498824
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	1.9851583558363284
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.	3.2675772273695145
I just wanted to correct this.	2.8432113033907993
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic, social and environmental sectors.	2.5487450872401056
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	2.5942614924719933
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner ' s answer.	2.7140067301929007
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.	2.224557982895465
Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property.	2.02762234872352
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation.	2.164742678991372
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.	1.6969669166223116
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.	2.463848992512913
The post office is democracy.	3.4051084657830577
Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	1.710738230990331
It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia.	2.2820086060375546
If not, why not?	2.176986471645928
People must realise this!	1.7743331213853129
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.	2.150110736428134
Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control, damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity.	2.4015059909074745
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	2.2589698445218924
As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos.	1.9195801874065925
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules.	2.6947181667006883
Intergovernmental Conference	1.634381472350212
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.	1.6969224165658923
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States	2.4528442652337374
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain.	1.8034312130937324
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously.	2.268662843167129
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People ' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent.	2.497612184750912
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament ' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine ' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	2.5263181561087986
That would be a similar situation.	3.3620894668181274
First OSPAR.	2.573534076645813
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.	2.6246837541501087
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.	2.2805375230880633
Including Jörg Haider ' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	1.9008660291866426
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.	4.019042661948253
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.	2.40236449681106
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	1.779606412885748
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	2.2564665164715123
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.	2.2026709834555884
We already have legislation.	3.2658012939944143
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	2.464501960424076
Thirdly, to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite.	1.9018284696245682
However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens.	3.7040142090586774
On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion.	2.128304677326055
Cederschiöld report (A5-0008/2000)	1.3768379096132717
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.	2.177781864762513
Although Mr Corrie ' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly ' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union.	2.0781354393920624
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state ' s tax revenue.	2.2102157911914886
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	2.6197988647698187
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.	1.8638641147850563
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea.	2.2719204785899354
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR.	2.056750388930957
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.	2.1629207792459977
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen ' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.	2.5149212367432363
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.	2.4878713876463374
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	1.9937183140297907
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists ' and 'bandits ' ?	1.9931187280500864
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	2.0152214278861442
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	2.4497875429016984
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under.	2.4319410259061405
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal.	1.996403673360552
This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters.	2.5338265118904904
Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe.	2.2378705816812676
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.	1.7337237988344318
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.	2.7959235851504447
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union ' s institutions.	2.1308653912183457
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians.	2.6705931093835824
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	2.66102318887802
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute ' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.	2.1906177886541744
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	2.0219375583541033
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.	2.312163352986301
We are, for example, still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize. The recommendation for this dates from 1996.	2.0493787456127084
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.	2.2786746296310283
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts.	2.464914294833789
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.	2.39252312350184
Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.	1.8082473523008888
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	3.1910859123826203
Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment.	2.8363790006158127
The results are certainly not what we expected.	3.230410137805014
Mr President, Mr Fischler, my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues, as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen.	2.0414851243710257
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.	1.8299901812686468
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	2.621744080208708
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation.	1.9194386992771622
The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with ' , etc.	1.8855815751401779
- (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately.	2.0978929310481145
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January.	2.6999920966245092
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account.	2.33374885335987
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	2.4515333852860306
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions.	2.8337104032889893
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.	1.9856134712237858
It is about artists ' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products.	1.9922684806269495
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.	2.4681582428953597
From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles.	2.48545953632811
A communication later this year will give full details.	2.119122133374459
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.	1.5846225009925972
In Europe today, the tourism market contributes 5.5% of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce, approximately 6%.	1.922557381242117
In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe.	2.257599036122222
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.	2.2170541482536597
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	2.879497610141053
Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.	2.2330199582884673
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	2.3061048318382062
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.	2.7416901588309446
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament ' s opinion is.	3.2416638468034447
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries.	3.1649257252733998
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	2.0775016019512442
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	1.5563765771300215
It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union.	2.2451139917758973
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars.	3.6195931525938243
Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage.	2.12940710765646
However, things are really quite different.	2.484402489929478
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?	2.320070296769115
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive.	2.523907829248714
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.	1.4757414069236565
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants.	2.116696041869016
When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost ' and an 'obstacle ' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care.	1.8140582512193015
I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."	1.9316088158473612
We need a public debate on this.	2.7772044989958555
So again, rhetoric and reality.	2.1616613143007464
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	2.265508932776472
Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report.	2.1577008166515586
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive.	3.038706266067222
Commissioner, our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas, while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing.	1.9197630320663897
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.	2.8677394937891085
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	1.968696972687564
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged.	2.6108790334239473
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.	2.228261154749524
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women ' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	2.2595492337902336
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	2.101816904888008
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.	2.560984196061621
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue.	2.3634587365998088
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable.	2.8746037435424285
Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions.	1.6945016849120107
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	2.330972549406571
We have thrown water a life-belt.	2.830300184895793
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.	1.9850267580103085
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form.	2.5981810243021703
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.	1.6159498097303655
I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion.	2.170178534415161
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	1.582408929381203
Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget.	1.6067578339017785
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	2.5379221785467045
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter ' s report.	2.0957778587087836
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions.	1.9865636497918528
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	1.7707818057820397
(Parliament approved the joint text)	1.5047002582325815
Now, more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south, the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges.	2.0043829575263223
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.	1.9562900831658425
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows.	2.7181993200895955
Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	2.228617638095675
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.	1.8950164820623479
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission ' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.	2.6289875831221585
We agree with many of the rapporteur ' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission ' s and the Council ' s intentions and plans concerning social protection.	2.7285237418368338
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.	2.940862734419862
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD).	1.7323016346768443
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	2.538641402839548
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.	2.1755063360270177
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.	2.825974558048291
In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.	2.464168521996849
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	2.086863824385559
This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled.	3.198153999134714
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	1.7842991291592933
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.	2.5469020590603093
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies.	2.7134131162346224
Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises.	1.9442276872497055
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.	2.904288488839873
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	2.9961693535211107
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	1.7098598263000588
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.	1.7344750041809474
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission ' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	2.335623887193324
For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances.	2.3342749324271344
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.	2.053097258896544
Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country ' s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children.	1.6662580413048034
This is not the usual state of affairs.	2.5612009292673497
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	1.6221031092979183
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe 's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.	2.3863205536380008
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	2.4746266086005857
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.	2.339242055654281
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	2.3683289097563707
There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me.	2.319289271097459
This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union.	2.2471865293960978
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	2.4651208978249497
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	2.390041096078047
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	2.4215672713136236
Proposal for a joint resolution on human rights	1.7594361216571817
Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest.	1.7310268688696107
Some may be better than others, and some worse.	2.042471852877442
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	2.1105326976449788
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.	1.964567070837272
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	2.081086597335672
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament ' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	2.485687117663503
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore .	3.01548300743238
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.	1.8571667570809505
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	1.866484377687047
In view of all this, I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism.	3.3213701778822586
Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure.	2.1674577355733877
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	2.5851985933488932
Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom.	2.1288130346818672
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale.	1.7583863646601927
It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available.	2.0310712745966715
Parliament supports this.	2.294221332462415
Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go.	1.7442026448157069
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency ' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	2.1471944589277285
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission ' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	2.3816689445853263
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	2.520182231996683
This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income, with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies.	1.964461716262228
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	2.550889924126349
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	2.638516903330442
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.	2.491467719335943
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	2.376027449642575
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments.	2.5182792717653184
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	1.6078470485508711
Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said.	1.928323459941784
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	2.590350853048835
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.	2.1879034263012547
But that cannot be helped.	2.6995730700623444
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.	1.9279288463113395
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	1.9011146881038912
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.	2.785211633592516
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	2.4317030612853148
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union ' s competition policy.	2.888210546430833
And this is the result.	2.92370312366996
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.	1.869995429345064
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.	3.1115048303103294
Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified.	2.1601572829464057
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation ' of the European Union.	2.0620341733091405
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	2.8974572221557664
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.	2.7523513734907024
That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment.	2.1502789630518815
One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion.	2.74639834104095
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission.	2.471024470651248
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.	2.7483866142736737
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	2.2113583443258884
75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions.	2.4209160317841514
. (FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.	2.4327131818246257
Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals.	1.4455560040320705
Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups.	2.3492990443525876
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	2.5690498659092906
To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks.	1.8364834706920883
This is the price of the future of generations to come.	3.2142252849325734
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.	2.1654342154966026
The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain.	2.3568768862667344
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	3.1158212258299733
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	2.604266356706157
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	2.6476569308136986
Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter.	2.102826210618116
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more référendaire.	2.673099973441199
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	2.0091004116710867
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.	2.0928726168103022
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.	2.0360447752585618
I welcome Mr Barnier ' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	3.439854965582506
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	2.5775873279670907
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.	1.859939806029894
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate.	2.52829692006134
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.	3.348696935171172
If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive.	2.1641426431411084
It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history ' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	1.7712670801785506
A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden.	2.153534588302382
However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive ' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment.	2.7310218805471327
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.	2.4167028477142347
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	2.2389493400033356
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.	2.0235199801963693
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba ' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	2.5803841066649094
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year.	2.6197023329501885
.	1.374839594702952
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	3.6585002003728833
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee.	1.8780174008563468
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.	1.8455788629230068
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.	1.67937489282842
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	2.1860017825880274
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé, preferential access is only for "essentially all the products of the least-developed countries" .	2.147254477338631
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand.	2.432049295752464
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	1.899454264276375
The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance.	2.024458549003425
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development.	1.8910800490247097
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	2.777237633980397
And therein lies the paradox.	2.4026711354970454
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	2.6270309404318586
Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union.	1.922810660362833
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	2.0519333430474664
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).	1.9044838619838242
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	2.6772345065416254
Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources.	1.5405045159906552
The European Union ' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council ' s conclusions or in any other statement.	2.712803642599174
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.	2.4981214182506437
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.	2.2404587309269637
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	2.318147006036917
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.	3.01601651942701
That is unacceptable in a democracy.	2.5255700327236617
I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe.	2.2854201494434023
This is a basic element of the decision.	2.886919396735069
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage.	2.758365578826318
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	2.5625211940251655
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	2.5016616509421135
I am waiting for the Commission ' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	3.2617095452579985
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report.	2.273437583461754
We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction, giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth.	2.038024141521551
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):	1.8523304489894463
If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres.	2.1527100514909914
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.	2.218639700966368
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.	2.350639322586476
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.	1.9781052296798058
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	2.4366216716735454
Thank you very much.	1.796622429959308
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	2.1968576675967206
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.	1.5595062858525364
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.	1.6935626532959247
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.	3.1223687625609227
Unfortunately not all, but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it: Italians want to see what the English are like, the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins.	1.9038756889979733
In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU ' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector?	1.9914967349682762
Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	2.286298034030461
(In successive votes, Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)	1.3182152261098943
We have taken good note of your intentions.	3.0642528630120083
This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures.	1.7760977932464899
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.	2.4548490733424195
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	2.4501267387031502
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	2.1780372202403875
The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America.	1.936400920852152
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery.	2.116162429116733
In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too.	2.9354539971313005
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy.	3.811502178261586
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	3.5732110111265105
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	3.581505142622141
I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.	3.0881918767385304
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	2.073898244957239
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.	2.433756123220964
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	1.9177883415820711
I am, however, optimistic.	3.729060336571961
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.	2.393869121838467
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.	2.558101885825414
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	1.8395687811506676
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.8266253287942256
Regarding sustainability indicators, the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue.	2.004502663428663
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.	2.294890893299357
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	2.065952838975335
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.	3.4882241956524633
On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package.	2.323823732521658
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	2.057262350367217
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.	2.5602961772247164
The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika.	2.0976967560669135
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	2.020219904712298
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	2.8150505596716253
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.	2.7460881050732904
the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Council, on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax	2.083242632363123
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	2.058797062293745
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU 's financial support for less well-off regions.	2.4347226945585776
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information.	2.596588083448908
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly.	2.9202265235160527
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.	2.2043046366227905
However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions.	2.3028483036212406
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission 's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam?	2.2736418202410706
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	2.287167907026776
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.	2.7863771964542456
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.	2.4627536345479157
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.	2.0817011030192067
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.	3.3859742741659886
I congratulate him on his excellent report.	2.9134310006302195
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	1.87422988219211
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	2.511794224075712
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000.	2.441442218000615
All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO ' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor.	1.7856092067705525
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament ' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all.	2.335139293525672
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable.	2.3430609682068066
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.	2.474051630657503
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	2.1225704066507034
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question.	3.444223721632047
The Council ' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret.	2.9057928500119767
For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use.	2.8262180261339394
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	2.633968880574814
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	2.1661421794065543
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress.	2.1917107835620118
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.	2.0652070069710775
Mr President in office, ladies and gentlemen, I have great honour in extending a warm welcome, on behalf of the House, to the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Havel.	2.538913680787469
I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.	2.2628635863951105
Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.	2.0231475214842485
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	1.8451309085142171
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions.	2.363635719711125
In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction.	2.5381540452660456
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	2.3639423823708943
Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people ' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion.	1.9638600733639926
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO 's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo 's minority communities.	1.8737005894987555
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200.	2.002334958412209
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	2.2507887293919473
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	1.7394507706383056
The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo ' s administration.	2.4400034870452822
The time for action is upon us.	2.844355130479065
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	1.8678195810394753
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.	2.5301205375306104
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	2.703126060441525
We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers.	2.189735668921801
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.	1.6952496386193876
It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious.	2.7262061183680038
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	2.277264934338636
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government ' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria ' s governing conservative party and its policy.	1.971689330124128
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.	2.5052076968551558
In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites.	2.1899565524625966
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.	3.2610245401285143
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.	3.123304961354334
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city.	1.9005211757741638
However, according to the SCRS study, the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries.	2.0188298689236297
The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU ' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field.	2.06942948037941
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes.	1.6745381951416989
According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful.	2.1478912850002083
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	2.707577094281653
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council.	2.584022341668716
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive.	3.2556083688195736
On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4.	2.194049350655835
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.	2.080439996939872
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	2.767385934897622
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week.	2.0222934695508004
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same.	2.3145824019274124
Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts?	1.6521866727516548
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union ' s development policy.	2.1635168199255728
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes.	2.977954499830291
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one.	2.693764751145981
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.	2.8747760258404353
Women are no homogenous collective.	1.7416829831835667
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	1.7162607636884877
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	2.1365663459870996
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	2.309800496379168
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	2.4380225926066426
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.	2.157226284708885
This is not our opinion.	3.0688401727232173
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	2.4411295715594745
I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people ' s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course.	2.361357102616388
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	2.8658015301543123
The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States.	2.044728872741027
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.	2.549315411624976
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	2.521242044847041
On the same day, I understand, Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead.	1.766067584813109
On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law ' and 'wilful murder '.	2.0101153035511823
But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested, for example, by China ' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China ' s human rights record.	2.147857575149383
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	3.1865126072896963
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	2.6898997386191414
(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) - Relating to Amendment No 9	2.3454462713334006
Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson.	2.7057083340983943
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	2.162471826253385
Report (A5-0087/1999) by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (COM(1999)148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)	1.9297618494821476
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.	3.258778940359029
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.	2.1407024328309805
Answers are still awaited.	1.3715978384840157
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	2.299705970376141
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.	2.214294278441454
Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so.	2.267270678608735
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes.	1.6331460083368536
Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta.	2.106830691076988
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.	2.078390603036376
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.	2.6657204195633586
Mr President, Commissioner, in this minute and a half I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Schroedter.	2.562663721510179
The call for women ' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women ' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.	2.456674227619798
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection.	2.365283371972147
The term 'tourism ' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.	2.1803457477045836
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	2.1091904680337588
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges, in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.	2.521621928062658
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	2.7711144786009543
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.	2.0666524054552116
The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field.	3.3185832317997113
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.	2.653072921550672
It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.	2.655384887253133
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.	2.8779404130388353
Second Part	1.5397459407995964
Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos.	2.7950440210001273
I will give some examples shortly.	3.033661933335606
I hope that honourable Members will realise that, regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind, the day-to-day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say governments I mean all governments.	2.083370533842018
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur.	1.9133770781590815
It need only be fine-tuned.	3.290943000044955
Why not?	2.0120056423985493
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel ' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	1.94845026366647
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely.	2.1868886241492422
We share them with everyone on this earth.	2.585944545281599
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States.	2.7115309594556845

However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.	1.9212168578281863
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	1.78131336362469
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.	2.544765316913369
Furthermore, on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons, I shall, in the next few days, be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.	2.2997068221407457
Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards?	1.8735631026527422
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	1.9267709545059315
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	2.250610276501451

The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance.	2.6283470989967808
All this is to the good of the consumer.	2.4358681305535783
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	2.2112968806471067
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission 's work?	2.369378886352104

In this respect, we support Libya ' s participation, provided that it recognises human rights, renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process.	1.747079194295675
. (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union ' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.	2.8248554885523554
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria ' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	1.7111141451773466
For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement.	1.9501061984258297

The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.	2.071566564188547
Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal.	2.0407320554101736
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	2.5091712759142966

Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	1.9829750989513573
However, housing is specifically excluded.	2.5940819144898826
We need to get into that conciliation position.	2.5406788339160467
It is still not an insurmountable problem.	2.890901998000308
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence.	2.437001973308564
More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised.	2.572522365589605
The party led by François Mitterrand, decorated with the emblem of Marshal Pétain ' s Vichy government, the party whose leading lights have just been caught red-handed once again, living a life of luxury on the public funds embezzled from the students ' mutual insurance company.	1.6835721712954717
Combating certain fish diseases	1.3976777142661514
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope, as Mr Patten said just now, that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.	2.023213109154646
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	2.0857527431075846
This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances.	2.568466443061891
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	2.2898106389612916
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.	2.361907346853498
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.	1.9637746845287554
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.	2.8677433507676597
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.	2.9099074335600292
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	3.153964178548279
That shows that competition really is working.	2.4662186963249
It cannot create jobs just by government spending.	2.3254482873608464
He has convinced me of that.	1.854659999697637
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.	2.822820054504383
Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all.	2.4507162761826744
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies.	2.1089174463094142
In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then.	1.9462428860581809
There are two reasons why we are saying no.	2.6112506439206835
We can deal with it.	3.243000771133936
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	2.2677851455945173

The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.	2.011498111178472
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.	2.20133346558061
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups.	2.139215168582286

The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty ' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.	2.3447857782806256
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	3.604376874292341
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission ' s attitude to the issue.	2.4019325785845775
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	1.9498652392290285
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	1.9198119478413453
However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	2.2127900994448773

During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity.	1.95920324064672

The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.	2.321659094326673
The first is asylum.	3.396669034603681
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.	2.6422678910264845

I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion.	2.824905707077861
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses.	2.210144931616324
The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.	1.9361350074052368
Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	2.06235837445259
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers ' liability.	2.9012502004220586
They want answers.	2.7084853276887753
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.	2.2847847037887252
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.	2.562582892487228
As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation.	2.629015090045922

I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.	2.5667913754313663
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.	1.809244451968465

The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations.	2.200916408405016
For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States ' social security systems" .	2.5565660198761058
The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS).	1.9198308461647524

The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion.	2.8146472660788233

People should no longer be forced to move.	2.146918915021445
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility.	2.6219494485461823

Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.	1.7434918599310918
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	3.017733203607308
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure.	2.327799468923779
It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	2.049136070249554
The difficult part, which will fall to the Convention, is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties.	2.3396340319586
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention.	2.145360200197348
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	2.315657756340401

I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	2.5719410320480214
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on.	2.5232878714927316
In my view, it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the Union to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining.	2.9949967645394193
All over the world, Europe ' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.	2.928220803635381
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	2.4053805630333405

That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.	2.477275155708176
In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba.	2.18040405920788

Rather than using the word 'enlargement ' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance.	1.8212779060231956
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy.	3.166867517579075
They have paid already.	2.4146980007749983
We will cut them off.	2.9544987472763764
May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallström to Mr Martin?	1.6794742160235119
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.	2.5639441193667056
I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area.	2.713892689524558
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables.	2.265632112700913

Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients.	1.810025563194346
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties.	3.0593698593055683
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition.	2.5585294315204523
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	1.8177548856606967
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.	3.34104542215243
Mr President, there are three points I wish to address.	2.767399149177743
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives.	1.8472224696415285
Finally, I thank you again for this debate.	2.2705937177804767
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	1.7694115321614394
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections.	2.1801253501315303
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	2.6815157738118045
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	2.240237558886728
I am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.	3.050781700385767
Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too.	2.418222687478114
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out.	1.8582954541611485
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	2.0837691187833283
On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.	2.0580285960569245
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties.	2.698634388721224
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not.	2.3045186557161834
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	2.5659972611688078
It would also appear to be in the Union ' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.	2.8961698829718587
This will dramatically change the way it operates.	2.9752871580003655
The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry.	2.7586006229572093
We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.	1.8709425834196596
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries.	1.4741012723518285
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	2.149962823687446
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	1.7798575837581743
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
I urge the House to support these changes.	3.2852901648463817
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.	2.418585352396313
Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important.	1.8307754171599953
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	3.4488068377902703
We therefore support Mrs Lienemann ' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals.	1.8579459862232364
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work.	1.9418256324679628
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote.	2.5431878566322186
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	2.781750330936976
We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies.	2.2147527949874655
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake.	3.8949520685915124
If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method.	2.2728334481523786
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.	2.5516584472698343
The situation is badly managed.	3.1888669669800356
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force ' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.	1.85462515520098
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	2.0509347409111145
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court.	1.9903511695058582
That cannot continue.	3.116176125699073
As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes.	2.94908236703972
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	2.3395058888012947
Mr President, I almost feel like saying, "Phew" , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work, and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.	2.607998934766176
This is important.	3.332441476865602
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	2.8129972169878465
In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments.	1.8670900681526839
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	1.9536633063781839
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	1.4254196276797875
One urban district post office after another is being closed down.	1.8938169993653524
But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?	1.7713198828723802
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	3.0128777867342076
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	2.1707874316007634
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	2.2766244149846413
Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of "centre of the debtor ' s main interests" .	2.262443825737306
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	2.0372334775391896
Secondly, the financial contributions.	2.4230384499015085
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.	2.4939140446226333
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	1.3486758245463883
Some of them are our ACP partners.	2.1780591578476405
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme, the presidency believes that it is worthwhile, bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty, to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.	2.732135316520737
But I would rather like to say something else to you.	2.6879438329791037
With regard to the Côte d ' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities.	2.4461708380245253
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.	2.646202359946987
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently.	1.9426119479374166
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	1.7868053755450306
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution.	2.39877968391684
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now.	2.7349768012704305
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this.	1.8233660756755947
This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups.	2.418625355152417
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream.	1.7501991293857413
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	1.544628484044692
In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic.	2.282554294666309
In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market.	2.171448050911797
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission ' s watchdog.	2.9381819036712966
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	2.971982021142104
However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law.	2.0850878838892446
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.	2.396420310928183
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	1.9716390596821916
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	2.115982176957077
Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself.	1.8280305843833422
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.	2.569315098516265
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.	2.4141265772941405
It is very helpful.	3.1908729748717
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.	2.8095994581731105
It is extremely important.	2.8113389820759096
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner.	2.8949816442134506
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned.	2.0444155578766496
We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue.	2.3748812308853
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House.	2.3573661392671883
Mrs Schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	2.420188533732946
I think we should take a more positive approach here.	2.9938003563363886
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children.	2.1837423259231503
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.	2.1157634846762536
The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future.	2.6554679300781707
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven ' s sake.	1.687741290324875
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.	2.2979668612075943
Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country 's respect for and adherence to human rights.	1.4853925381888846
He is not always right, but in this case he is.	2.4109200557635626
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.	1.9052735963687164
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity.	2.9397456680071095
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	3.2013967564014534
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	1.7915406254739041
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance ' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	1.7094148730908518
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.	2.163118192446741
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	3.626398021123558
Marketing, reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of profoundest change and improvement.	1.9035090061247169
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	2.595698151223101
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.848462825470744
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.	2.353411065561847
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.	2.3867286833376684
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world ' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	1.8520104845350722
In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" .	2.11404382848623
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	2.025701205360375
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world ' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	1.947858098130188
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	2.5688051047665734
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	2.1787342202191247
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.	3.095704993485572
I feel that today ' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider ' s party.	2.6383579386507114
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today 's agenda.	2.183420470748852
B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain;	1.6758577494283617
Madam President, reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process.	2.371121054091659
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime.	2.430087248959599
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	2.3585481255042913
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi ' s fault.	2.221993774365715
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures.	2.195058933548765
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place.	2.8054792082213247
So far, as you know, this has proved unsuccessful, and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary.	2.5450445215819157
Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens ' rights are only respected within sovereign states.	2.189988576716739
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	1.5614470746542657
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission ' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	2.6159885670615783
In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants ' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital.	1.7722577233805663
Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency.	2.636034678881834
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?	1.8783836333597215
In this respect we must not forget that the original victim ' s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated.	1.9889126837646531
Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	1.9655127151657543
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected.	1.997142645348372
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.	2.8079627672245677
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	1.772132016307223
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon ' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	2.2258944873534885
There is neither coherence nor human decency here.	2.0424495638208318
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.	2.1570114266807856
We want to bring this across in Parliament.	2.7475895149776273
We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told.	2.1692509818402175
If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	2.2925869498075975
For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid.	3.271222651729429
These are the areas in which changes will be made.	2.147698262616423
I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community.	3.0433850818300923
So much for the quality.	2.272866848464012
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	2.2163263579677595
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.	2.3781432451450417
In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel ' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail.	2.275717711232463
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	2.4298473023365332
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.	1.8162269184768878
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.	2.5561080900973883
Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions.	2.341096598733762
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure.	3.3123915043031853
Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left.	2.5605406994500135
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	2.8477685740527865
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	2.6173542193262005
One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.	2.070350954259352
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc?	1.6183302465900054
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	2.1867873045867685
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe.	2.1243630784152376
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one ' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?	2.088626713729459
- (PT) Although this Community initiative, LEADER +, follows on from previous initiatives, it has some unique features.	1.7002814375838364
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars.	2.4689286450325807
However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement.	2.2464802046416277
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.	2.0412636179238786
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.	2.1951740755966
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	1.925063122586608
I think we should give this some thought.	3.0886787456220204
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	2.200269771828615
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	2.475571812573882
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way.	3.2193635206702296
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	1.7904305894505248
My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.23656936571499
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	2.435564787233521
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions.	2.3206559699176315
We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another.	3.1680598063430785
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	1.9896213828242408
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence.	3.135148987215583
Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them, after I have had them translated? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication, which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy, and what is propaganda.	2.3316663314174035
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region.	2.581108432851731
It is not just a question of style.	2.8828894922955595
The vote will take place on Thursday.	2.163742432545279
Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.	2.5240313399146075
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	2.160544159380844
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved.	2.4607829771302097
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.	1.754762652595777
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	2.083197970347367
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	1.9918121801237414
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	1.9251631479021583
I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.	3.094884278559062
The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming.	2.5361816480666834
Well, the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face.	1.5461506468186224
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities.	2.344120960268615
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	2.0901385519708287
I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries.	2.3583147500014037
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	2.4944909785169576
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.	2.573444776648111
This is an arduous task.	2.7692520726871925
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.	1.9647186631099212
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.	2.196015129768422
In other words, a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous.	2.306118475999179
As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now.	2.835387116523178
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	2.5200531009100144
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters.	2.631628404845519
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	2.7871998241643317
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.	2.560979274610648
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Culture, for the firm and intelligent position which, each within his own role, they have maintained during the entire conciliation process.	1.883339429180383
Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests can be guaranteed.	2.9297670386293104
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.	3.4409019864244215
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community.	2.3586597153684226
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	1.3527814307988855
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	2.4293036695042396
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.	2.1255050800405773
The smell is absolutely disgusting!	3.4654752000355384
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament ' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.	2.3299927374190554
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	2.4721402205228933
I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?	2.500949667892033
In its communication "Women and Science" , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe.	2.2197072866880267
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success.	3.1399709585380564
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.	3.424082308373685
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit.	2.340217882676721
Since 1993 the Commission 's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	1.9122488758182479
Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.	2.036472089685658
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?	2.1861744039652713
Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN ' s Resolution 1244.	1.9730709259530215
As for the time scale demanded for the directive ' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive ' s implementation will take time and considerable resources.	2.370787520997628
I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity.	2.148640458304279
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	2.3181800135359136
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.2183945468114763
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	2.8502964610640285
We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia.	2.3386360722219743
We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	2.1523600130993263
Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid.	2.2310903168137393
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	2.230899337710612
It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive.	2.1971353891566796
Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come.	1.9384613156033184
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.	2.7270738633005633
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.	1.9450096568899071
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	2.493580744978286
I would ask you to support this common position.	2.764967565774967
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.	1.7503977288250554
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate.	2.07370454806929
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises.	2.1637976416898406
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	2.32849516572814
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	2.6885258617791927
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control.	2.3067366547241606
I am very fond of him.	2.948019207892113
It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children.	1.9345699156944751
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.	3.616616570018397
Mr Corbett set out Parliament ' s concerns.	3.325806719029813
As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees ' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.	1.9296622058509807
That surely is in everyone ' s interests.	2.3694148770299894
The Commission, in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission.	2.296174174830203
Nevertheless, these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union, despite its well-known human rights violations.	1.8891869930217915
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council ' s wordings are the best.	2.5097118192686287
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	1.9042846399420266
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today.	2.661053030998923
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable.	2.35076501952892
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.	2.41364977541015
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.	2.1030426588268907
Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi ' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for.	2.1899652973903128
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism.	2.5682419657437556
However, we must stick to the facts.	2.349293655662027
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	1.6556457494732089
I will end by congratulating Mr Viceconte and, as one who comes from Crete, a tourist area, I ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a Europe which needs those jobs.	2.3344121230578203
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.	3.034688735736443
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.	1.7950797900493192
I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.	2.6906560227040925
In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model ' s approach, which is one based on solidarity.	2.8989662453817955
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	1.7871652801115367
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.	2.157367170262951
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	2.0811992814158677
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work.	3.178809528843855
Who is going to pay?	2.1929707255325126
Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start.	2.101953403703168
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.	2.7175946388693557
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved.	1.8629558451992743
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	2.434712472166238
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	1.9913357828096356
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure.	2.9543623245756936
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.	2.1270890816058645
After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers.	1.98821200667282
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	2.495843176023964
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	2.2482518664443583
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.	1.332786307219827
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	2.3080278730591854
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent.	1.8316441912884962
Oz ' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press.	1.5046935670987684
This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities.	2.3681674843898874
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	2.854567022144496
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say, and I think that they are right, then to take up another six months of the Commission ' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible.	2.691024111658265
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.	2.2063431117478625
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.	2.5314524062380146
The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy.	2.6741712484353783
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.	2.194655813967458
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	2.126416809720235
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.	2.26807838913485
They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood.	1.7740783039815557
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	2.2348474169454597
However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text.	2.904708110315451
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies.	2.19280551821523
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.	2.0857932662726943
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	2.2588781843807753
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	2.6390569876266334
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	1.8372775945140194
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	2.6708258756636307
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.	2.382605428248108
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now.	2.4828715493843214
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.	3.289674281162886
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	2.4952628631888603
Madam President, I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri.	2.3140416349241426
No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties.	1.9985560433271397
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?	2.125685167648872
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed.	1.9530194356855066
Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors ' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services.	2.407711490244504
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.	2.755508464075542
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council ' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	2.41750109045253
It is, in fact, something very positive.	3.0637744541849883
While others may have the biggest rockets, the EU has the deepest pockets.	1.932417050222869
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	2.7816282264511742
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	1.9725101048344575
In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas.	2.0683435453196553
Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this.	2.6444042120157194
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote.	2.433314863577877
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).	2.175647880890202
That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work, and we should recognise that.	2.1011958760377367
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.	1.7861769708007789
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks.	2.166114965946743
The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion.	2.2010031974277227
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.	2.36165692777689
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	2.179303624504232
A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises.	1.5846315840995466
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	1.5061350955480164
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.	2.2188826785764575
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation ' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.	2.2422578816413368
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	1.808065843645313
The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna.	2.1930876822358054
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.	3.2638830034075093
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.	2.401682196832955
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that.	2.0031510157301566
It raises expectations, but it can also lead to disappointment.	2.670039446187816
Mr Andersson ' s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU.	2.749675485518817
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.	2.84141463330581
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	3.006950053642355
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	2.285138091841489
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):	1.7453051511156166
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	1.8990738490485253
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	2.284831910655105
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	2.40786830999697
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here.	2.856668879727291
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	2.3284312230472373
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report.	2.7788578781084596
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	2.634739426119851
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	1.9094055866394593
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU.	2.2911882584595884
When I read Mr van Hulten ' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	1.966229763987233
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.	2.5173963824072594
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	3.2420446029474537
Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe? ' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage. '	1.9304137612601737
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	2.060464770903869
I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.	2.01739864965881
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA.	1.865366383484847
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	3.192008341077978
Protection of juvenile marine organisms	1.4854221294418446
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	1.971919542674432
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.	2.2324798908571717
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.631362131495539
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament ' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	2.611492649646805
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.	1.7125650335109195
This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future.	3.030300381128459
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax.	2.307417145973087
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	3.0787838917138153
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.	2.331081163827328
If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.	2.416848536780592
That is what Culture 2000 represents.	2.148757626768506
When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed.	2.952168169831909
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	2.210107622992366
The applicant countries ' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems.	2.4074927963010992
This is an unwise policy.	2.7411812384845318
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	3.0317090230355834
The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7.	2.2886589891855267
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.	2.635225830076883
For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas.	2.0531610518850756
This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.	2.9961807171088974
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.	2.1679032976661543
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.	2.6202850464827128
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.	2.5205393295107594
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.	2.210275513878938
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	2.552726616228491
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation.	2.659227930218881
What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps?	2.3691560519061006
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	2.205794697102867
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.	2.2759014106174975
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000.	2.3377127182156663
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	2.9319831141347894
Atrocities were not even being recorded.	1.4760288324875255
From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer.	3.043878682819255
Excesses are no longer the exception, they have unfortunately become the rule.	1.5959504979028731
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	2.086975507078366
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue.	1.9450762213156996
Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version.	2.1631424243733064
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	2.896437786291149
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	1.997058511950892
The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy.	1.793734764203476
After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International.	1.9814741735465524
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report.	2.422992900652017
But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.	1.9474934827592612
Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage.	2.555487340928425
These initiatives, together with effective systems of control, are the key aspects for the future of fisheries.	2.3435208307894837
I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out.	2.031679011524139
We feel that these issues result from the IGC ' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.	2.3663111329093236
. (IT) The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion.	2.1294436876403466
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	1.7818715073359859
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	2.1504155242310876
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	1.8493153783446197
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	2.3258063308209413
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	2.1658884594634458
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	1.9875157644152548
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	2.290959486509123
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the European Union and helps the more or less disadvantaged, island and remote areas to stand on their own feet.	2.2330738879099115
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.	2.4090666877823534
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	2.7848246072102283
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations.	2.754850608651401
I will end now.	3.745741352761835
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.	3.026334219951163
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.	2.2712810306192983
We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe.	2.0254691787257477
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.	2.7663178705373164
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays ' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment.	2.2934032310412586
As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF ' s financing, or rather lack of financing.	2.2916032400277175
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	2.3635384382506075
Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.	2.2826404950270445
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.	1.7711601450504493
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.	2.5652448132895103
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe ' s rural heritage.	2.275961176354589
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	2.1797743114740196
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC.	2.626052386777352
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	2.5356382169102045
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory.	2.366361973461925
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is.	2.757783801205769
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	2.486653691390089
Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important.	2.1278528512355455
What else can we do to support this opposition?	2.779153844539026
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for .	2.4778647154507536
Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million.	1.7893594345467678
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)].	2.0122825475027524
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.	2.984344432882795
I am glad to see that Parliament ' s amendments have focused upon this.	2.7015784452659766
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind.	2.3063922499314105
Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry.	1.4607890722735262
What is now needed is action.	2.321916990377538
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.	2.2493637304060083
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	2.2188391549092565
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed.	3.8494950275367747
As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity.	2.519960883927371
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.	2.296882114339418
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored.	2.35439659326912
Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners ' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific.	2.3085745693960664
Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee.	1.9167218835148188
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.	1.9251109222056362
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas, hops, cows and Indian hemp.	2.14238660547025
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	2.2449651912833595
I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries.	2.44560552849165
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.	2.525661750838975
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.	2.284657273603598
But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	2.2653339017900276
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	1.7854929217039943
Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds.	2.1406213559609557
I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line.	2.3880756223315744
The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the "statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues, 13-14 March in Bergen" (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS).	2.3842677868776287
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter.	2.2808859445304783
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	2.3784343543450066
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	1.9875049187836342
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed.	2.0572161591441334
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	2.2876544562534176
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.	2.652482064206351
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	2.3566313030049444
And do you know why?	2.5323657825022687
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	2.35082050670779
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament ' s plenary sitting today that Europe ' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.	2.530555080517119
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.	2.6307474962018667
A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable.	2.1833931783768037
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation.	2.5378360823685053
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	2.6113360435412427
Mr President, all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds.	1.8711675239038392
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	2.6570738507712113
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.	2.427794633986998
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	1.8490928656194692
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.	1.912429178023366
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	1.5677626681289734
There is a blatant discrepancy here!	2.3196011767115237
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.	2.1787286685414395
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials.	2.5560216720657154
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	2.601929003876483
There are a number of sound amendments.	2.792056610151908
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody.	1.7273855789926686
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council ' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body ' .	2.5886196539122346
Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.	2.072547505362057
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	2.234921253425918
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent.	2.152064657339887
The principle of specific, exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.	2.7361803189551863
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met.	2.6370786428520687
What are the conditions for this recognition?	2.616284558491064
At the end of the day, Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.	2.0410580644755543
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.	3.319325532365546
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	2.222583700103731
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	2.3352615849458576
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer.	2.5622119336105587
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.	2.341977125309644
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	2.137422058219759
If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development.	2.4194136964847854
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission 's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	2.3904263892579007
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners.	2.0823394952260235
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	2.7198448211442092
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable.	2.774571102265784
I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary.	2.5194291394589534
Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.	2.3975274475354453
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.	2.014468837671457
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	1.9733045205254556
The bet before us is a bet with time.	2.801010160148315
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	2.031600117850519
We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on.	2.2053900855358473
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	2.189642941075496
Finally, I welcome the Commission 's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	2.8184902739399726
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	2.686149830405682
For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	1.7806297085099128
Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries ' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries.	2.1377230568223857
The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different.	2.3722677737123443
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	1.9225332722881456
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remains, however, one immediate problem: the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted, many of whose lives are in danger, in their flooded villages, hoping that they will be rescued.	2.094950176641239
Justice needs to be done in East Timor.	2.1256124849589293
Madam President, I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease.	2.8576644032782617
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	2.380712080118027
But we need that reform process.	2.40403058620854
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.	2.360986420534326
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.	2.1843670042599954
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	2.303151389447773
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	1.9600961290151113
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	2.497855176955487
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.	2.676304336420272
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.	3.347821583796536
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.	2.4302786184020273
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired.	2.0985136811629803
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups.	2.1236937658490915
If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish ' .	2.227332736702055
Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe ' s main fears.	2.235801376378381
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	2.146153377714779
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	2.7540760944071883
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.	2.9129231782739775
That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place.	2.2686079171574027
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice.	2.0795915585355993
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	1.9966434206711448
It plays down one of the Treaties ' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions ' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.	3.0009331003098176
Turkey 's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey 's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	1.3676259454474584
I would quote Gaza as an example.	2.519840027520539
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	2.1885454287939283
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	1.7399503004140426
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe.	2.398448234445598
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	2.189354726539649
As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China.	2.4444131198353687
The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial.	1.995442492346419
It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.	2.299557217805809
But we must look always to subsidiarity.	2.5955499152167
Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council.	1.945477263110748
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.	2.347590138265317
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups.	2.4175538658176388
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	1.907960719987151
This is a pity, in a sense.	2.4485323552282448
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	2.3178811915160185
By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.	3.0093091622004993
Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems.	1.8918286562038498
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events.	2.1175912451674797
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile.	3.804841109766285
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.	1.7650288362061413
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters.	2.072523957709773
That is most certainly relevant.	2.5255345008806813
I know I can rely on everyone here.	2.7381048897294673
And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition.	3.031908322092853
Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.	1.6809361748879543
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	2.7815208986395614
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	2.8122490150190114
This is the Commission ' s own survey.	4.605240240924865
To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79.	2.74474917783748
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper.	1.9849785929344241
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods, about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance.	1.8133296327398447
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	2.619918255752098
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	2.935186170457158
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.	2.183317065860461
One of the very first speakers, Mr Wuori, spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel.	2.0026178146502254
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	1.8484672408056029
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	2.1805404605036682
Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises.	1.4598153849629096
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.	2.049093550982288
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver.	2.203004881989308
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	2.1583845329830855
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	2.9102299136970284
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	2.3904882200930375
A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.	2.1236343885598123
They know full well that they should not commit these acts.	2.478788641799399
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	2.5381269713341363
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	2.701889747207227
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.	2.719596403339887
We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.	2.3513462425085994
Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation.	1.9529395491064712
This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers.	2.8721627190384296
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.	1.9559362849804265
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union?	1.9918314790101472
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	2.4010734895174664
Is there any prospect of membership?	2.1001102613066314
Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly.	2.5208192198228865
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.591476154890115
In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament?	2.227022819314444
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process.	2.579922638139981
On behalf of the House, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament.	3.578860731480466
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	2.4430455230535273
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm.	2.152854679057996
There are problems regarding the term "author" .	2.2116235757280474
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better ' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations.	1.8661098281396364
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	2.255912775183004
For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report.	2.0504517580636885
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.	2.405165840975269
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	2.1210913106878593
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	1.677686599615604
I have therefore asked the European Commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at conserving and protecting resources. This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions.	2.2689468437216194
Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice.	1.746893721125062
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	2.0221642518662293
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	2.7535028564183515
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent.	3.6940522115642778
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	3.0502438590201
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	1.9136325032973032
The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one.	2.534006531289504
Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.	2.1688326736084944
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	2.8134389594407403
I consider this to be very encouraging news.	3.4137182301993065
(FR) The Lomé Convention, on which the entire structure of relations between the European Union and the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries rests, is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north-south relations.	2.040309799731229
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	2.631010595064487
As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December.	2.392512648384937
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	2.283533344987671
The issue is as topical as it was before.	2.8896759555113816
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.	2.3521452567560535
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	3.1020752959051374
He has done really good work in a very short time.	2.146537206967918
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union ' s institutional bodies.	2.455869652295874
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law.	1.7711103085230837
But, Mr Marinos, in the EU context, culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas.	2.420307939270979
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee.	3.4227532663344014
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point.	2.2468577563628007
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world ' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	2.015388969180714
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives.	2.457877732352814
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	2.5020878490994365
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory.	2.1839434396952715
The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.	2.1207223333476004
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	2.9242364145778392
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	2.1047710162837987
We expect the Commission to implement it.	3.6566429680262513
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.	2.351130624589946
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens ' loss of interest.	2.6067261924665632
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.	3.107082052505211
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity.	2.3729221100375515
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.	1.7835464182899996
These discussions essentially cover four areas: security, the structure of government, territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation, as a result of the situation following the partition of the island.	2.0601792363141436
However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission ' s proposal.	2.512532229593337
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	3.956550148259417
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.	3.3883106984726448
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims ' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	2.0765090824128736
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed.	3.0516727836776307
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	2.2183221017218844
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.	1.8281410214349811
As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery.	1.8196295854952202
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.	1.9572394057302145
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement.	2.6402520286738933
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	2.344983801745257
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	1.83418995706912
This is the challenge.	2.9835025202159273
As was emphasised at Tampere, and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies, which strengthen the links between the Union ' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union ' s position on the world stage.	2.610231577479291
These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union ' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment.	2.434148735497517
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests.	2.6517986588906157
The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed.	2.43814223301389
In view of this problem, which seems to me to be the most serious, the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points, particularly with the rapporteur ' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission.	2.1705245711898566
But the figures tell the true story.	2.3030338254473026
How can those affected be compensated?	1.9143636324298752
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation.	2.4777610088942716
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	2.6364881442295465
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering.	2.907541161021413
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.	2.525503261025156
Is one free when security is no longer assured?	2.392250633978978
The second principle in the Council ' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.	2.9782466420611713
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	2.3143690514286726
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	2.2058648887005132
To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned.	2.1927361086713093
Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets, slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half.	1.5118647725802714
Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?	1.9363643535520567
We consider the English version to be the original text.	3.1827388550902516
Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption.	2.110547991981001
If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned.	2.1292108921327597
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg.	2.615660621000917
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament ' s assent in two cases.	2.454863292190279
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	3.141152660313319
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.	2.2457900484600226
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.	2.191067615388929
We need, in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe, to go back to the natural order of the universe, i.e. to the Creation, and beyond that still further, to the Creator ' s intention.	1.9148796867389692
But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing.	2.528934123447338
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	2.4835213765519852
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.	2.589554957474666
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union.	1.897230597917897
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.	2.0161298939058363
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	2.2404245798920557
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.	1.8590143569775424
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	2.9642520860004264
Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato 's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia 's sovereignty at Rambouillet.	1.9809092051493207
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.	2.4558846002604047
We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet.	1.9727624275370914
It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.	1.8755343625769072
So that is the world as it is today.	3.100836346341471
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	2.8815857529968234
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	2.2049103552464695
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%!	2.257004706763066
Are we ready to pay for those resources?	2.174715285275552
At the beginning of December 1999, the first round of negotiations were held in New York, after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island.	1.8825273099959976
Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission ' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament ' s legislative powers.	2.5782741792525274
It will be there for some time to come.	2.838873367018448
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	2.0073413370481474
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.	2.309603156643377
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	2.7676268626562446
That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts.	1.9136754311074746
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.	3.2807418940665443
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries.	3.6940041100305203
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.	3.2114963825515086
One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny.	2.2057602690192017
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	2.744951701298996
And what exactly should be done?	2.2278879190526975
It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth.	2.3202095019291757
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	3.3416978729015883
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament ' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.	1.9682713187313958
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years.	2.4611252785709423
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other, make it urgently necessary to define those rights.	1.940743246346864
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.	2.2601140168078206
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes.	2.3667243911688556
We should be careful about this.	2.808965808771178
First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes.	1.9920991033371145
We cannot be accused of bad management.	2.750738811464295
Why has the Council not informed us of this?	1.9165159905050035
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations.	1.7470722164031856
This is a big problem in my opinion.	2.521174075776552
It is shameful!	3.5876275797655515
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	1.5331270582223289
In this field the Commission, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.	2.836084779683194
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	2.8186824723695483
Nevertheless, I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity.	2.6726106581436917
What are we actually doing then?	2.121715901532864
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.	2.7910295252733888
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	3.0357672220855045
Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully.	2.266762599003503
Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless.	2.2830757830309087
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3647183468043427
I condemn this, as well as the Council ' s absence.	4.098070033025859
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	2.5148456977822473
As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens.	2.0294489351713856
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	2.1053348061815966
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.	2.9191665929507638
I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved.	2.430007200460243
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	1.9025547048011058
Many speakers have underlined this.	1.7873464818946787
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	2.005292624930295
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide?	2.45400914408551
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.	2.3416967355618303
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	2.207248771286086
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	2.365207838265224
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.	1.914944146201828
Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment.	2.2455128257038632
This is what we need for ships.	2.9759237100106843
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	2.5540523007043756
Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets.	2.2435402730245997
The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.	2.4225391457266485
At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them.	2.1436660363557873
The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today ' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement.	2.420710866538147
In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.	1.9524984189890684
I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue.	2.59036974322951
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	2.0135760919215526
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People ' s Party has been advocating for some time.	2.1163045136242005
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.	1.7740705981199871
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group ' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support.	2.778862943697267
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	2.9403428039372996
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	2.1967222717636448
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	2.796128064339265
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary.	2.4318893833025794
It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable.	2.045809541193969
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	2.1127059341676597
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position.	1.687241590437528
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.	1.9231412760252096
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	2.068278655176099
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management.	2.3067142642453398
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences.	2.556744355256248
However, I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created.	2.2200098597450113
This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen.	1.9668401734378202
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.	2.446495874648672
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another.	1.8057710018446969
However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general.	2.252887568028147
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	2.4629061062675244
It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission.	2.5659478459482323
This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example.	2.372845167104533
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	2.9873089054361444
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	2.2651557176995842
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	2.3014509295382246
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	2.262903749845566
The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself.	2.443352261704999
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives.	2.5940870000772884
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two.	1.8929417974420837
It is important to point this out.	2.6681878594695934
I cannot answer that question.	3.137709334557214
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.	2.7174340210017833
We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically.	2.5482722545198095
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China.	2.0154750375308774
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before.	2.5472137264988928
Clear progress must be visible.	1.3379366784630944
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	2.421218565853984
Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances.	1.6495941704695725
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	3.1114525303915053
That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used.	2.3893320161594
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	2.3420432994972766
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	2.3134441151575893
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.	1.757471011582282
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament.	2.3390759109490356
The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.	1.7873511593694968
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!	2.093746497892564
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	2.463922935528571
Not to save jobs.	1.9915984829271942
In any case, the Council ' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime.	2.4261436036994684
After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.	1.9909065078088934
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	2.2767562602820903
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	2.2676222110330597
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle.	2.443143819362027
Madam President, on a point of order.	1.6008080479545364
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union ' s being able to function come what may.	2.6460585481001293
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.	2.1710683886066313
In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate.	2.4260741653555007
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	1.9915387199193029
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	1.8769780092785746
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted.	1.7060852908289008
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on.	2.09176986543378
Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.	2.0805375289422248
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	1.9310687364460508
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	1.8808806715610986
This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before.	2.3794643938846773
It is better to do it absolutely properly.	2.7870261578351956
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	2.4533604317990676
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	2.290157263471545
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	1.426916947743193
This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data.	2.10109704068847
This has since been unanimously approved.	2.9118690967343053
As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	2.1499628536285194
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue.	3.1717430715186805
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket ' .	2.136790733088508
It is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises.	2.3978441572623996
Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together, and of course, it leads to peace and understanding.	2.2037400700446383
I understand the Commission ' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	2.946968677630658
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.	1.9391378299208275
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development.	2.01649925193937
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	2.26960278612673
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.	2.31847183321573
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	2.4152494566659617
In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked.	2.262975341777154
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries.	2.335712754781146
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	2.4480051306611545
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	2.333355581474534
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.1365857008194604
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.	2.3131343843618524
The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments.	2.3174705189838147
If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets ' suspicion of the euro.	1.795765076664075
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	1.8095585294590493
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	2.761120731392078
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	2.9355800008013597
But the source is threatening to run dry.	2.274984263837768
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.	2.447582052086967
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.	2.4043399406601935
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history.	2.3679860765008756
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	2.0300012236754355
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.	2.108429714965372
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model.	1.7323055701663923
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.	1.678709428541484
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	2.9183694027308618
I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy.	2.229961772841508
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late.	1.6218122884165247
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	2.2254365770825206
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	2.478740855584721
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	2.630784835009139
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	2.2001976019748875
There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies.	2.532460020113362
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	1.9950917685134728
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	2.4126012042872835
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters.	2.7293580975347176

Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard ' .	2.202427923964979
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.2834708624789584
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	1.9553629540305586
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking?	1.7331016658304494
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen.	2.0467934203890237
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.	2.823816963433493
On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year ' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000.	1.9089061386371031
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic.	2.6191230403958947
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary.	2.063745189297598
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	2.5082527658705147
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	1.6514132160766368
One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern.	2.0824553186017827
In anticipation of this EU directive ' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied.	2.4021592966678735
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	1.8523559405648438
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA.	2.0045443021581617
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.	2.652381039825237
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	1.9581913651409704
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.	2.0557373257265876
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.	2.9012617168213835
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.	2.5729243037695904
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.	2.768336591932829
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	2.0967425391109074
In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy.	2.132324825042699
Both parties were once part of the government.	2.5086899932193725
The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats.	2.056947969203592
I perfectly understand Mr Staes ' s concerns.	2.543727454660404
These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.	2.378475380728906
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level.	2.455696495954768
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	2.1514300606261045
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency.	3.1239488190029334
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on.	2.511759582749414
In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks.	2.377387156039783
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	2.279869654439727
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.	2.4150974996068917
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.	2.499457978240798
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.	2.1896610847403726
Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh.	2.165198748426401
The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost?	2.5810835133814725
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	2.1326126719668164
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk.	2.0773273446545972
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.	1.9796134640623784
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	2.009572994888057
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne.	2.4507501810036323
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission ' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made.	2.020616477224054
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	2.375995597697759
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.	2.486399920105581
You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better.	2.2530848739682092
The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)	1.7429202528025096
If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them.	2.4715655742544085
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	2.24328901255043
If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression.	1.9637995643926485
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	2.19722425672611
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission ' s proposals on this matter.	2.811191771788868
There must be flexibility.	2.538362543657195
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.	1.7037919449382435
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.	2.705215616018263
Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	2.3880262249060875
This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China.	2.3657949258028133
Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself.	1.7497004726989795
This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort.	1.9156119419482582
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	2.3560128439217367
We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy.	3.154259326012495
There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.	1.860255514679621
It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner.	1.9711115608655077
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	2.6821821870127733
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.058606931441408
A report on the work to be undertaken, together with the Member States and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now.	2.76234820919259
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	2.9258366076419158
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.	2.4899207014428044
Are you aware of this?	1.878364142037718
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission 's accountability to this Parliament.	2.715757483266936
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	2.549518539186353
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote.	1.6463948386088125
"On 17 February, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, received as guests, at their request, the representatives of the Forum d ' Ermua.	2.0603946233658204
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.	2.197118921680424
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house.	2.173086292737199
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	2.5937665677465254
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure.	2.74939426394873
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	1.8674125629210714
We really have not progressed very far.	2.8571277935254145
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	2.2318383167126954
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance.	2.7550562519057102
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.	2.4281417251934325
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness.	2.6561209033554376
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	2.3551406797850576
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	2.3886921273221633
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law.	3.020096275075238
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	2.2191155885566913
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.	1.768172036968104
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.	2.158838873182979
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions.	1.8146019313763788
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	2.196367773838753
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	1.9454486456280868
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.	2.5161902583150026
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	2.0756451052904294
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	2.241218964307976
We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.	2.0756318633129127
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	2.643105171583147
We are always saying think globally, act locally.	2.462460360593003
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	2.5896691273430705
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	2.2984078724540855
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	1.9673536301403776
Madam President, the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions.	2.876241398290515
Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives.	2.95734207407295
No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low.	1.9408474667063926
A5-0038/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 541 - C5-0302/1999 - 1999/0218(CNS);	1.8902640608005647
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily.	2.6762912061543624
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	3.988399732018856
And now the Erika.	2.5388776217953373
The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary.	2.1280957858845686
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	2.0280409357686087
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.	2.8629009642590098
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good.	2.584541682207994
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities.	2.4962957818401454
You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	2.030089447719063
I feel, at any rate, that for the ultimate application of LIFE, at least, there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment.	2.733477514293381
On the whole, I welcome the committee 's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann 's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.	2.1836325861223145
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	2.2775395874718214
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.	2.29223537446804
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	3.13702669601111
However, we already knew this.	2.526004361727348
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.	2.1867824543135206
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion.	2.0178969942715095
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	2.316066352551973
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	2.0577754210848718
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	2.37637980569163
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.	2.389150117282707
Europe is a community of law.	2.2406467447609417
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	2.0800721347131743
In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.	2.197788138437401
As the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, remarked in a dramatic appeal, each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans.	1.943586276698498
But Europe is changing.	2.9260612008203126
I am very concerned about these translation problems which, unfortunately, we seem to be having increasingly, and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed.	2.4221583489594583
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights.	1.6718398647226471
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.	2.1868922228307426
We do not think so.	3.0275135492509304
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued.	2.882835572240818
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent.	2.2182596788368696
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems.	2.7450846994239373
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.	2.1495773178925077
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	2.209425596661235
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.	1.893422824500943
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men ' s lives.	2.1537887204456756
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	1.8996720438650176
All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa.	1.8903715728136903
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.	2.441308902614003
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be.	2.424438105457471
Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets.	1.3818499106764601
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.	2.129595310083409
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	1.9603629160789537
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	2.4991459764349004
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	2.1289423500572258
For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.	2.4928263690093844
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.	2.5139086692707555
I believe that is a good thing	4.07846910680574
I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.	3.2994786199046993
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.	2.277017939021636
Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)	1.9252102726888678
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.	2.2495949384413625
But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.	1.9367104596896187
It can only approve Member States ' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	2.0052745696363714
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	3.4542350393987107
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council.	2.4788876980288093
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings.	2.2987363778330736
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"	2.225524710421819
We want a colourful Europe.	2.8405557108130575
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education.	2.24896728546567
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.	2.118895756945403
They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species.	1.7121954108680466
In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States.	2.4955341944596525
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.	2.5644544955822965
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	2.3245532494522614
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	2.143733076686093
Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.	2.631355275217308
When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs.	1.8367228843765282
We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved.	2.457151795115255
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved.	2.4303050812825018
This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development.	2.0088377315951638
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East ' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place.	2.478178765244991
I do not use those as an excuse.	2.776997001895522
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.	2.5625811496796107
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.	2.5487861479996887
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.	1.879162464492393
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.	1.7076787545068541
In any case, the Commission ' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	2.262454255371175
The rules for management companies, for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business, are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations.	2.36503633730481
That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard.	2.4273734261974598
As regards derivatives, I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example.	2.144229789444263
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.	2.2992340553782857
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives.	2.6311710376473414
Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes.	1.9452571222412132
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated.	2.6287720770332323
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	2.472193339762884
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applicability.	2.1130813914183024
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.	2.8472791570861484
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	1.7378011850253947
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on.	2.1669861700306434
I welcome Mr Amadeus ' statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU ' s emerging common foreign and security policy.	2.0828601862617098
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously.	3.3437442674759272
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services.	2.2306919460066763
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.	2.8234906918906857
We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination.	2.3286896358362275
We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence.	2.1399356752961545
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.	2.422894105689358
The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical.	2.6978836394822427
What are the Commission 's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	1.7310096109868907
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.	2.152917167781775
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.	2.6190390025944135
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	2.742017087350473
Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union ' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia ' .	2.06132846242962
These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT. This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament ' s role.	2.6797376590708075
The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.	2.404881616931108
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.	2.1814160067385524
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	1.6380757574360096
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	1.8562800505151937
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	2.7056054340313023
In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States.	1.9911433694853304
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.	2.1326590212284975
Do we have a special problem in this regard?	2.651153974439161
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.	2.1285958985841926
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	3.334581607955177
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP.	3.513873354715038
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	2.499045359452236
What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment.	2.4318538011746624
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers ' main claims towards the highest common denominator.	1.7757188863686573
The most important parts of Parliament ' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle.	2.3127052820496092
That concludes questions to the Council.	2.4247748851377757
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.	2.5170271730473446
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	2.2965562392543544
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.	3.2008098995780565
Lastly, I believe - and this is also the presidency ' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations, given the skilful, intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General, and the UN organisation in general, have conducted these discussions, and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties ' positions.	2.431164555068475
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.	1.923630477266084
The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	2.6942006294099055
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	1.5519433470528616
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights.	2.86384953144453
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	2.039394902705407
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level.	3.022177139159904
(The Minutes were approved)	1.3647183468043427
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals.	2.786116103012528
Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution.	1.5086692288026762
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	2.8429330310816248
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.	2.1930939459404364
It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else.	2.0419069387216493
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	1.3969988248453984
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	2.459828265405068
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	1.765464203772791
The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas.	2.6250113644581106
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job.	2.5015597953510356
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.	2.5212450407950557
Even in this Chamber, the Council ' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories.	2.746341208324415
They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.	1.9199779980794989
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments, and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which, as debated by the Polish parliament, fill 140 000 sides of paper.	1.8770305510779992
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.	1.9620559763354748
Relating to Amendment No 6	1.8978887843428547
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.	2.8663360138798932
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	2.0732427718344364
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action.	2.8088022670517785
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population?	2.0870299241537476
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	1.6776705415412743
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.	2.5492601168139633
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	1.5110333181890312
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee.	1.8741227521044568
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	2.0942693265808745
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision?	2.1744770055061817
We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired.	2.4091211520142344
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States.	2.117927604060177
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	2.3280255705420005
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.	2.4051465976139
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	2.312776326123859
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
In this respect, the Commission ' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament ' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	2.1666134402259583
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health.	2.0933364340606033
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)	1.5136840182211826
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament.	2.3013607719653435
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	2.7458249415367115
Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products.	1.8468297927404325
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	3.4356774981807154
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	2.2772377112252764
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance.	2.4847379722961183
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States ' government deficits.	2.6398712722676643
This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.	2.4157750522482395
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	1.9955811300457338
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.	1.6436682404140275
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	2.073893404928566
Consistency and action are needed.	1.3290599187528316
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	1.9632635999292039
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that.	2.130710115126489
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime.	2.3419923600301273
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	2.531526989846177
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	2.297934559782666
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	2.661605227883021
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	2.6060212800558884
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.	2.3624281334942654
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily.	3.3850501124324506
	1.0510108151299706
With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission ' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000.	2.5894868560242843
The shift in meaning is not just semantic. The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for.	2.063885093256284
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	1.8986319048165807
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	2.0580560059380826
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.	2.451978765892078
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	2.0852133527172563
Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report.	2.5750089109091627
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.	2.1465307871297536
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	2.165871713124362
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	2.118178666867042
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	2.067353786794061
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam.	2.577759287472984
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	2.544867551841191
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	2.2835953355752237
Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999.	2.7892781542425094
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.	2.657575403444007
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.	2.3422553268072317
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	1.961051184205649
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	2.1505287847038996
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission ' s response to our requests and demands.	2.21273259791359
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.	2.117813522124196
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union.	2.5049528342815304
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	2.5013569671688405
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one.	2.651204687476425
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction.	2.6220854667920936
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.	2.806068955810244
Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism, sanctions and are even brought to trial, such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced.	1.4096005908430869
We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board.	2.1304749315749754
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF.	2.6015964807802914
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time, but then it happens again.	2.133516471989494
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	1.4373961738462724
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.	2.6904191041140035
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer.	2.797745271798735
This report is a wake-up call to Europe.	2.627246713633805
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hudghton, also for this report.	2.3368133444865515
As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts.	2.021647722084515
These are the main reasons for my vote.	2.24047828963222
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	1.7865862902324214
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.	1.924233229707215
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.	3.0018549576766116
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	2.947832830034642
Parliament has amended the contractual text.	1.847706195768948
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	2.034509779203636
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin.	2.462062838814345
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals, for the provision of cross-border services.	2.4285826516353066
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	2.7960080344723646
I have had a little to do with this too.	4.171743074686856
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	2.2292155948903494
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	1.6143801273419303
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political, and has no basis or technical viability.	1.986200739725473
In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services.	2.654076578435901
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	1.993825126351718
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	2.337500421793007
The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures.	2.704301674253321
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done.	2.4912979499761905
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	2.2364864042127444
It is quite the opposite.	2.994804001890877
The European Parliament and the Union ' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia.	2.3288249835012382
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.	2.197536770778015
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.	2.9827361326125836
I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area.	2.294610491348448
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do.	1.7010719241621373
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.	3.1045758270463777
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	2.0557965364210546
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	2.766771628408346
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.	2.587216150282798
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.	2.8267694308613005
All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report.	2.480271343917399
Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States.	2.0456078947341467
First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector ' under ESA 95.	1.9706104963465458
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts ' and 'standardised options ' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments ' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	1.98404758245582
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	2.2778290728251522
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	2.4849187556819623
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.	2.188914988075392
Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems.	1.8840503039829206
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	3.3126898462091536
I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50% self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information, that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk.	2.450675691909323
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved.	2.0865994331354227
And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long.	2.187968798534568
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.	4.335654889992732
Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple.	2.115851248723384
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council.	2.854476773183357
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	2.445496208444351
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	1.9046515511240585
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio ' s action plan with open arms.	2.394222587450788
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.	2.012272939278571
As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken.	2.6893577628586125
As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate.	2.073210383823317
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	2.3538530563028695
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	2.245691456436115
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?	1.7418967271162973
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment.	1.6786660579361106
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.	4.0101453387197505
Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries.	2.6200221674651947
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy?	2.916817585299346
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	2.186917713544665
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	1.9812454335592415
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.	2.2885809518689837
I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer.	2.5008152125099965
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that.	2.147227555189105
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	2.6886524794863442
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.	2.356265053353869
As the Parliament ' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.	3.017560504824897
Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers ' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe ' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	2.0092294940139936
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?	1.8944929121404792
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	2.197707957771894
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.	1.7476120180789751
On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion.	2.0346591440890256
Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation.	1.9714308419113664
We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content.	2.296783871208335
A new government has come into power in Austria, comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities.	2.0487086313538896
Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy.	1.600645382769067
It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding.	2.134838483906553
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	2.3240219212481823
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	3.4438008256130472
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	2.5136582121380457
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.	2.089056947805448
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	2.4320219361538475
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work.	2.722501147293986
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.	2.1769614301739493
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	2.5945632280115674
But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.	1.7124180468146528
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?	2.390440266700852
The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus ' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us.	2.4497022873109637
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.	2.1452936815724657
We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security.	2.5266757307609717
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.	1.9150829923008303
Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido.	1.8997904622935577
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands.	2.030006238982509
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	2.560329093703581
For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption.	2.238289024260387
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.	2.6180929423999766
Thirdly, because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals.	1.9407738710799705
As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them.	2.121823682930126
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received.	2.638253499094609
What is a fair society?	2.592001580472354
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.1325599612027553
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.	2.2980377841373367
This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme.	2.1984888552967408
I think that your proposal, Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote separate, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date, is a reasonable one.	2.5947474893089604
It will have to initiate these negotiations.	3.7222009620485133
Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures.	1.7334570659118886
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	1.9763179302752032
The after-shocks can still be felt.	3.2902039279736837
The general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives.	2.1788188290133745
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	2.488413902340399
We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution.	2.549669868263208
It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes.	2.569406106091638
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops.	1.7226452439926898
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.	3.059206439493122
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance.	1.9740314938069845
By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere.	1.7866460573061675
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	2.1234864061817933
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	2.517654085957003
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation.	2.778262277465237
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.	2.3564904009502103
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	2.305554217238313
It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact.	1.9702056057819703
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	2.2482611321384325
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	2.579577641388818
The "physico-chemical and ecological quality of water" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally.	2.2432038851914364
I would ask you to use the full name of our Group.	2.712288338224001
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.	1.7194180007146298
As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.	2.13844298902331
The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans.	2.109811958444306
That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, "mono" problems.	2.0617499582298984
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	2.921322460513354
However, I find these passports inadequate.	2.3312491240308333
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life.	2.06271765268854
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	3.340859047899597
In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.	2.0243727864812504
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.	2.6061962195477646
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	2.314412729064995
We need to match this vision with reality.	2.312709475450188
Both of them have done a first-class job.	2.235229638467925
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	3.207715606531976
Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field?	2.469284141111827
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.	2.8966098242103606
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	2.1256079590015196
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions ' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.	2.260795436764019
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	2.385508754355551
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.	2.6428703190695795
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	2.6309201713694463
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times.	2.4709150659471373
In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project ' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above.	2.0643572327125055
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	2.0797537981118888
(FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency.	2.3956228338076913
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution.	1.9506769364108179
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.	3.043303471050817
. Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services.	2.4218954827689374
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality.	2.4259819262020845
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	2.026060626874007
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?	2.19301842015358
In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation.	2.6309558677532174
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	2.996120015717498
This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China ' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States ' initiative.	2.64940879987154
In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102.	1.6077195147616155
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right.	2.5094620862468298
A number of codes have since been introduced.	1.9150498646519465
We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.	2.6571572090692217
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme.	3.446635969526036
I would like to present the Commission ' s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament.	2.5026343219395386
In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU ' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance.	2.90497928848043
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	2.793546442747076
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.	2.729351990464597
Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British.	2.448888177189349
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist.	1.8587219461029463
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward.	2.034398110209011
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	2.3227233264319547
For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola.	1.729012913647197
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us.	2.4070895619420196
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.	2.920675749184393
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market.	2.1988824350213925
I therefore wonder whether the Commission ' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation.	2.560930677141414
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	2.5384230413398012
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	1.9787460015762535
VOTE	1.0850475141586433
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	2.0236288464454066
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development.	2.5922050085481527
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission ' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.	2.5867162414065437
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.	2.177470058959805
I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed, because you need to hope in order to be disappointed. and I have had no hope since the investiture debate.	2.8426434594575976
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority.	2.462980688816049
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	2.459933529314082
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	2.90632955052605
On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.	2.5257762263178156
Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them.	2.7482563197950163
Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection.	1.4772135102319022
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.	2.0326661011958387
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	2.39140366512676
It will reflect the European Union 's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	2.995178275098305
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	1.9584531853767613
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way.	2.28086977517788
It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health.	2.4830205028319963
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	1.6665998891932976
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	1.9337284108215407
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	1.5823840645450982
The subject in question is of great political and social importance.	3.380577479254829
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there.	2.800331434121883
Michelin caused a great stir.	1.4128438895171136
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence.	1.9167658754853887
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.	2.1773658312292183
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	2.245270614862389
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.	2.066054946214355
- (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999.	2.4163126924905987
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order.	2.4439060277212943
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases.	2.4554038806555654
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	1.9744444185081897
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.	1.8148844113557092
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre.	2.0564559705742367
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports.	2.165984420900823
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	2.849802098550036
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.	2.672350448747054
Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people.	1.4562213185855737
The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major step forward for the European Union.	2.252762903832573
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	2.65370139581766
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	3.324466822964258
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	2.1748257052354076
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	2.1781559892409086
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.	2.2069913965606216
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States ' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	2.7165631424948047
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.	2.0560779126056077
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest.	2.3232312259738217
I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	2.5389157084232514
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	2.388008651395906
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	2.7033967438557
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU 's food safety regime in the years ahead.	2.968535029490048
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
Report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission recommendation on a Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 - 1999/2121(COS)	1.9800474652897977
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	2.3192403576303877
It is Europe 's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	2.525169750712402
In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament.	2.198264315061455
I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail, Mr President, given the time constraints and also the interpreters ' fees.	2.3076529709105773
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community ' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation.	3.090464838304157
But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is.	1.9893950756771899
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever.	3.5739478163746474
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	2.3283930764206855
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.	3.1274068767885104
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	2.436833331881305
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	2.8966308676276387
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.	2.0192571768382277
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant ' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	2.3026577563315254
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	2.1242672689207804
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN)?	1.8632583828399423
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.	2.1290732387154145
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.	2.154440708726842
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry.	2.0570247615083272
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations.	1.9755255233599442
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity.	2.2495782395268105
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.	2.308902634512886
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.	2.5640711301469414
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	2.7170646111346723
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.	2.061814966013764
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.	2.262491759624137
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute ' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	2.7489884041729113
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.	3.0081221850651847
The Community initiative means community involvement.	2.9033784966968255
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.	2.202811203422531
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	2.258479326735294
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.	2.4557561249302897
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	2.4503281529736385
You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people.	1.8974057901691141
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	1.7289907666799453
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	1.9686289773697012
I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service.	2.44086298098008
As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners.	1.8992628552762498
Yet we do not have much time.	2.4469471621699155
-	2.0184696698254547
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia.	1.7272794886018645
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted.	2.1978686488047754
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.	2.6993693691860767
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture?	1.8143806742357562
Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture.	2.7269320830728154
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.	1.8416921084951035
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.	2.452656791184657
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket?	2.091317948987802
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.	1.822561260223358
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	1.5652132714023352
However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances.	2.145806099492124
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe ' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.	2.8775195028223806
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.	3.0033450732779787
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0132/2000) by Mrs Bonino and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the Commission communication on the strategic objectives for the next five years	2.1929182517937136
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	2.0549114398901454
What are we doing about it?	2.1637419170847445
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations.	2.5950392833148213
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this.	2.660708670948576
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.	2.1804928422792136
We need to take this responsibility seriously.	3.9425986472870354
There are many opportunities to hide.	2.322783343818546
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	2.3298233547827305
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	2.1575864186837834
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	2.5593801289356337
For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed.	2.686807417833898
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State ' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	2.3162276031958395
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law.	2.522263975691177
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are?	2.0658070180234787
Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory.	2.1381009503658848
In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people.	2.0653139803540514
Mr President, may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work.	1.9682411813480323
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:	2.7489604108628694
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	2.5875312547035265
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	2.151717554636092
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.	1.9415412862001695
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	2.696345556149011
Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission ' s statement.	2.7378341098769807
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	2.200193590723209
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this.	3.2314288151140964
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government?	2.1737620689084363
The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities.	2.68295757165842
The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems, which are not touched, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty.	2.512456062690588
. (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community ' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States.	2.2291787967631587
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.	2.2872505717178453
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission ' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.	2.5175602574746905
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).	2.7270681562755033
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO.	2.770848390441699
Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied?	2.490444807801257
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	1.775866153862931
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People ' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	2.0942092541239914
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.	2.1211434392430073
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	2.284589842580852
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.7737084791327264
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	1.8657658570543034
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered?	1.843460432957275
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data.	2.36869703193945
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	2.242683633472218
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	2.1183532196142343
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead" car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.	1.8715757257760353
. (PT) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals.	2.2069967495799228
Report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EEC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)	1.6512155166740712
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe ' s positive roles in history.	2.1444543950229864
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things.	3.2519565304244558
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?	2.1248812407399744
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	2.046485366167998
Mr President, Mr Katiforis ' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice.	2.2784806313584007
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	2.5650067183840393
These have been the most important moments in the Council ' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	2.614834578356274
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	1.6371352781430775
It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues.	2.833957768022743
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.	2.047118548457251
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	1.8059261984940116
That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon ' perfectly legal.	1.8380450468724743
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	2.387014351337046
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	1.6445841875548173
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.	1.8229804387062456
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	2.0000665986805237
Commissioner, it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe, men and women, are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations.	2.4670629211631017
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter.	2.4764299568632544
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.	2.417473565882343
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.	1.3883104949273013
.	1.374839594702952
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.457652188634284
Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling.	1.8492525626796503
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars?	2.1854281109170204
Women belong to different social classes.	1.8456045053629933
It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management.	2.1489575361247963
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	2.6384053053681304
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.	1.7067024262898955
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.	2.364766508555227
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	2.2686869827105887
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet.	1.949940694861424
This is the topic.	3.063428175623233
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable.	2.2503496853578304
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	2.3888211853903383
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	3.444564061576413
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.	2.6495427228448465
Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.	1.9411698946161904
I would like to mention one final point.	2.992005336575451
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century.	2.4270158111467883
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	2.6948063346697855
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out, bit by bit, because the elderly live too long, leading to problems with pension payments.	1.7918865194928408
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	2.085639880813385
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.	1.693675561973398
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	2.8208709347124046
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.	2.2836781874811916
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.	2.3928920982626765
I do not have exact figures, but the Community ' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.	2.2349139941652183
I would like to finish off with this observation.	2.3916952418186614
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	2.2197429664447488
Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women.	1.6953992823951016
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	2.0744853637542406
We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place.	2.288026304843558
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	2.2665469947088748
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention.	3.58957944901461
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	2.198662788231283
In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States.	2.701520815330093
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	3.0716104029281186
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.	2.9806614675449583
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact?	1.8507665946390124
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	2.176930554270922
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould.	2.5639798637077225
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make.	2.5719244744032137
As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend.	1.8551321069694804
Quotas alone are not enough.	1.3697648510007399
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	1.8796481911765726
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom.	2.827757882355584
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	2.0694166161283905
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets.	1.9689777723370998
While only around 10% of the world ' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there.	1.7801461584201659
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration?	2.1848511071046834
This has now been done.	3.2536282522409823
It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy.	1.9841922660354812
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth.	1.8335386540311192
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld ' s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed.	2.4021531253599813
In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law.	2.9923608831886312
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa.	3.6342842171414858
Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action.	1.7089927160809284
Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters.	1.7418365812309895
Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.	1.5588442333206023
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	3.1201597566347745
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree.	3.165786635622542
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	2.685975856870095
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	2.9163353965804575
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.	2.4572734994078074
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.	3.3782912607187447
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.	2.4760129004530556
Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays ' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill.	1.9082998683842398
Surely we should be more selective.	2.7711190263075602
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion.	1.341244544249065
Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.	1.9414021913737192
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	2.1927656497209322
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.	1.98630743679352
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.	2.3090399229090837
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.	2.170965801214311
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge.	2.820762122840882
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area.	2.549161826805503
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries.	1.5587077424489466
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	4.262768794507948
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.2507566612693095
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.	2.060012402813238
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis.	1.482345141994891
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission ' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today.	2.5732653025398027
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	2.055645892022548
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.	2.508149572399305
Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.	1.6905646823822924
Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations.	2.003055662898475
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.	2.0513710556785747
Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea.	2.2580047128574403
Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners?	2.5588773520062333
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.	2.7709422743632146
During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.	1.8855717477875151
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	2.1869320532459606
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States ' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.	2.7306461952528194
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	2.8697152151792076
From here on things are going to be easier.	2.746210895542421
B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	1.6771031863798262
Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue.	2.769989916833115
Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries.	2.144934135590463
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.	2.5426792883616502
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider ' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	2.135481085232719
The proposal cannot therefore be approved.	2.9406746174873777
Or on Shell?	1.7410902950801652
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	1.968222559714807
In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds.	2.1885383405157968
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.	2.8809646616210434
That time is now past.	2.912826015738283
(The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence)	1.523676903060755
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	2.027812032414393
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust.	2.562633585658814
This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo.	2.4804155007029203
It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures.	1.830594082628409
The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one.	2.1270136209847106
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	3.139783677285118
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	2.534462900611374
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.	2.402516366110927
There have already been hundreds of deaths.	3.0757364047043048
Of course, a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a network which will assist the exchange of experience.	2.6067704231312416
However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China.	1.9803831808542944
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.	2.058143729349704
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission ' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services.	3.0682800400973544
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card" and not "EU service provision card" .	1.982949318606462
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies.	2.4994159547853747
It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner.	2.707935258706254
The inconsistency is astonishing.	3.7184698468622366
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step.	2.9487485983983315
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	1.964398105073164
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	2.0935815291364435
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are.	1.9191378765441822
Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.	2.474820974572133
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	2.1438640661897006
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.	2.0806269059676055
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested.	3.28241846558184
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR.	2.1225724424587518
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally, and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome, so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme.	2.5595607344291165
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	2.185077522524964
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making.	2.5657322977595953
The Commission ' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives).	1.9149510548511512
First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.	2.3620992174528572
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.	1.395646244816573
This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.	1.9619003118159037
This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment. However, this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments.	2.2775294261973906
The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community.	1.897718622467472
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers ' expense.	2.3770578077384794
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.	2.3913389261620717
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice.	2.1525253192964975
On the contrary.	2.367822239568727
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread.	2.6785463619862315
- (IT) On behalf of the Italian Communists, I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document, which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for Europe up until the year 2005.	2.365424961434373
Question No 8 by (H-0042/00):	1.7808731702205087
We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented.	2.9952521431687895
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament ' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them.	2.145467594588299
In fact, we were shaken by it.	2.486259284727185
I very much welcome the Commission 's support for that bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about.	2.204569493353979
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole.	2.0201946541504316
Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us!	1.3801431947877567
McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	1.3118235152389186
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.	2.7391520163209533
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population ' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.	2.408804803025806
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets.	2.49373401688405
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned.	1.9943806909262716
In the middle of an election campaign, a series of authorities, all of them run by the party in government, made clearly electioneering speeches which, furthermore, were broadcast live on television.	1.9459791019617456
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.	1.9076880333133346
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.	2.1929657388995354
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.	2.0769073180587574
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	2.7705601235711717
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	2.5865546243588233
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	2.8181273536690967
With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation.	1.9830051785012437
In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	2.5853007702728736
The widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established, is, of course, only a kill or cure remedy, an ultimum remedium, which, in the case of Austria, can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective, and by way of warning.	2.22415767659922
As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective.	1.9425198724435804
In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island.	2.3804411988818717
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible.	2.615455076647941
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	2.046450323162331
Are these reports accurate?	2.088290479314381
I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last.	2.489456366317449
Finally, as regards the Council ' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery.	2.5184856092833923
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	2.0640393332269564
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.	2.7532540681360653
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	2.9046994547327287
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter.	2.7336983437166738
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13.	2.61784268514498
During Mr Bolkestein ' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."	1.878113998295543
Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union.	1.9212231578443146
That is the goal which we have to work towards.	3.3246796335566384
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist.	2.7502739131177436
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	2.0548600462082107
In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping.	2.8218436309088406
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	1.6520903565622531
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	2.7970830389798325
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives.	3.1579540876712278
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.	2.060891973917061
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	2.1930863085136822
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	2.728184949748662
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.	2.3707686357583815
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	2.2133197884379374
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.	3.103881100060282
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.	2.6008506529199753
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy.	2.504503322465306
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	1.5930524381968487
Until 1999, this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols (B7-4011).	1.6870340212339467
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.	2.255884283768103
I will give you an example.	3.089594668151121
It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly.	2.3789528704952456
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	1.8678304709545366
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet.	1.8620302036884622
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	2.093641218597634
Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment.	2.1109257812538003
Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided.	2.5369000884287294
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.	1.7428359107711966
That too is feasible.	2.664426362579994
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets.	2.456436436053652
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries.	2.4171218154723095
Let us remember what is at stake here.	2.2412695191285916
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach.	1.399399342423603
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations.	2.2365153684969266
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	1.871072299534101
No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit.	2.330025833326207
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	2.5214864097116343
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	2.528157631384435
I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March.	2.202354174060995
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	2.446294990122715
In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries.	2.3240526562440778
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work.	2.960428530155719
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	1.741624940381554
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	2.6955120255792964
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	1.9589297588536732
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	3.2329016022503327
We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is.	2.4225833719205316
This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations.	2.033827676068114
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.	2.511934672442489
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors ' need for protection and security.	2.0457167448625295
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	2.381114668499069
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.848462825470744
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	2.751249782073144
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	2.6721089250463317
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	1.9123755119471195
The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic.	3.046468182245818
There is more to be said on that score.	2.6235602639131534
- (ES) Mr President, I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party which I represent on this issue.	2.5620472682186137
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	2.4506751162686564
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	2.0653752481518364
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.	2.5622469656917475
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):	1.8828085297328954
We need to work.	3.0257522641041494
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal ' .	1.6304728213407123
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin 's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union.	2.6883547405465107
That is the reality.	2.572260065144045
In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one.	2.1282426161935315
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.332050177986208
The fourth group is legal certainty.	2.99001635602723
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	1.6333143177070009
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	2.2513711271420145
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds.	2.5914167552502345
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	2.7207369153616034
I note that Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base.	2.27385143260784
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	2.769190477913567
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	1.3430818945463838
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.	2.095215954189183
When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.	2.3788414697219875
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.	2.017851094791008
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	2.712792360923837
Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.	1.7011993685830333
.	1.374839594702952
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	2.653733630517853
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	2.103755547888096
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one.	3.061815410649464
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	2.0761603122239403
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	2.1965309750424185
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.	2.550219745303771
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines.	2.6707096758610094
In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment.	2.410913613675887
This is the purpose of these guidelines.	2.9908285002165793
Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement.	3.1859734078951276
Apparently, they were.	1.4808564304537437
The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions.	3.355805508203192
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	2.388762667268521
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	3.00608056678039
The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia ' s neighbouring states all the more.	1.949608317764855
We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee.	2.665047978355097
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	1.1010991385448057
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.	2.5718204065462094
Numerous questions are still outstanding.	1.504863791728952
I am, up to a point, concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.	2.662572358232534
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee ' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously.	2.0913639158559034
Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.	2.9185182158781613
This is a political question which, in the short term, requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament.	2.53304334116709
Despite yesterday ' s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued. However, the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments.	2.2364175497536167
Report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)	1.7716131553137957
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	2.482530273301911
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city.	2.0967020893971213
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	1.4830318930073516
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments very carefully, and in particular to the rather emotional comments about Cyprus, especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus, which the European Union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.	2.222484117204801
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.	2.142788886207673
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	2.139336961761071
Anyway, we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more.	1.5128819174012453
If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future.	2.069510557038816
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries.	2.706891708922665
Mr President, Commissioner, since the issue of employment has been raised, I want to recall another issue which is also very serious, namely the bankruptcies among Tour Operators and their consequences mainly for hotels, which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are trustworthy.	2.0173672621507928
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	2.1724003820615567
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation.	3.3008136591878405
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	2.1233625009034034
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	2.122710715001213
During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union ' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers ' incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.	2.4207080226880153
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.	2.0584461789907955
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.	2.7942360857817663
Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances.	1.4845113411248436
At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system.	1.6849848046387341
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.	1.9552654240167313
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	2.0563972367203256
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable.	3.015866916515328
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog.	2.5692497423552023
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	2.0402212995267095
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent.	2.650395923242499
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.	1.7729821970854427
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	2.4122498396676533
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme.	2.5400342513046463
This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor ' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.	1.9368296943415895
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	2.64273210868504
Another challenge is presented by technical development.	1.8213729002956756
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States.	2.530951957134958
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities.	2.342732613510286
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity.	2.720015673021225
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy ' matters which we need to go into.	2.37641544144431
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?	1.8923604716754656
From the Commission ' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni.	3.096153264266994
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	1.9497075239318467
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	3.4835859065918022
Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements.	2.2451429599633927
As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan.	2.0399444462503173
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.	2.160748208280425
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	1.89725169593651
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.	2.400622236521486
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	1.9379631415795977
Employment is growing at a good rate.	1.6506620786971309
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	2.031408357239229
To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors: seek better focus, better coordination and concentrated activities.	2.1426833298918475
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	2.169964619378862
., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	1.8637921076827362
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary.	2.166024735204754
Let us look at some of these reasons.	2.272169461993621
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	2.108520521753538
I expect that Parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	2.8311790893194635
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.	1.6706754199435856
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	3.0185863987030084
Should we not be discussing this issue?	1.617303491522117
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.	2.291402414469573
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	2.357059967986066
Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	2.1958533309099164
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	2.5628727872314765
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships ' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace.	2.4549794644238463
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):	1.8829430525401003
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.	2.3224502326538814
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	2.1054987738665023
Mr President, as others have done, I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced.	2.7358877250616027
However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union ' s most important programmes.	3.0918162484457583
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report.	2.2745713117223354
However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed.	2.3895163493254223
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself, and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes, included in Objectives 1 and 2, and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located.	2.392103550235254
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	2.0185936279694823
Middle East peace process (continuation)	1.6079674489556155
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.	2.2557569610860697
Agenda	1.0773763300143226
Mr Newton Dunn, I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question, and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future.	2.4839351284210527
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons!	2.1780373616609
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	2.0005400178018338
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either.	2.2460089371028022
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship ' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.	1.7615493495277825
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan?	1.827293433072563
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.	2.7926665491352223
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	2.2438573493596627
Native Americans in the US - Dineh	1.6662740831081444
In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state.	2.7263576000834395
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation.	2.829062228969228
"Condemns Mr Haider for his insults towards certain EU Member States and their leaders in the last few days in statements, which Foreign Minister Schüssel has failed to condemn."	1.9250034026757645
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	2.1367146489800803
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there.	2.216385814655241
In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies.	1.9029539121342995
This is my main concern in this matter.	2.2917875080722547
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.	2.1613281023927606
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.	2.9705706786889823
Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union.	2.3456937781822
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out.	1.9995548420136253
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten ' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	2.1096893492653397
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)	1.559943525418356
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.	2.3106043371732015
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.	2.0673454058492764
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment.	2.169253685892545
It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy.	3.125171052641616
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.	2.6844194945593167
We are talking about us, not Austria.	2.8207667531185354
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	1.8596465468394756
Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment.	2.2645086102946363
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet?	2.215027801230458
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.	2.68272210290691
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	2.0690539808237984
I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again.	2.409422707762667
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today.	2.2683545958322657
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	2.625975229509711
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.	2.086021739228034
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	2.7964200785949727
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us.	2.7968615704182573
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	2.701274394954437
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.	1.992782511252685
But what will those limits be?	2.4245362662276566
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?	1.6414181009444901
The common position is a reasonable compromise.	3.2692008830328283
I propose that the EU ' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated.	2.768524613775548
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	2.1530820222654468
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.	2.326499014165875
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	2.1038588441113695
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	2.334277793845405
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions.	2.733074719631139
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.	2.5448334381509894
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer ' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer?	2.519049855166948
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.	2.150914691592905
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	2.2742667581005263
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.	2.3379379172870363
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	1.9738838077957022
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.	2.5744405825418135
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	1.7835781884536368
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?	2.4571444081007283
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	2.0591893922892157
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union ' s regional policy.	3.1462146804416613
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	2.284918403588407
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.	1.857280878815861
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency ' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	2.60708174507904
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament 's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	2.4985071837424786
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.	2.443445647228246
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	3.1928772219489763
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	2.0550635276068507
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.	1.755663850343964
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	2.4165956253304874
Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination.	2.225631951808901
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	2.3140765117200144
Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa.	2.2940100412365254
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	2.2794829610485774
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works.	2.125099752303111
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights.	1.887647294310594
We have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones.	2.267246808752747
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.	2.3717532703421718
.	1.374839594702952
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this.	2.911970691533719
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.	2.262926541341728
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	2.3318209862691686
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has, in these two short months, organised the first Development Council, admittedly an informal one, whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations. Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered.	2.1148654920732395
I cannot see a reason, therefore, why a further extension for this measure should be proposed.	2.1700758356402106
Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.	2.8676195687961283
Most of Parliament ' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive.	2.367078540541872
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	1.893262128255814
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services?	2.1124699992135643
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately.	2.048203951080619
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points.	2.7948692273890723
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	2.2752516369135027
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	2.721236675337963
Community policy in the field of water	2.1186322165777183
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	1.8915098112544932
The French State has released funds for compensating damage.	2.4732720679464486
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	1.8892660852986451
Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources.	2.402995677139159
I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly.	2.812032726809594
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	2.7194494155265314
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	2.004792656604231
It would be appropriate, however, for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences.	2.287475966367549
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.	2.326215660806428
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	2.152880331126316
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that.	3.057216165824126
If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July.	2.2727135231591844
You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture.	1.874702131936753
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam ' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.	2.0097789529272845
'No freedom for the enemies of freedom ' was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago, the advocates of the revolution which proved, alas, to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes.	1.5899650361608606
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union.	2.08783401806522
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.	2.3419409504573587
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
Should we complain about this delay?	1.6120829362457683
We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.	1.970228414502596
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.	3.5011183861217585
It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences.	2.2617274182056972
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	2.9329584926545706
As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately.	2.394860725079657
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	2.2969719554295214
More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States ' ratification.	2.2919512344894977
In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created.	2.5019875344139693
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.	2.1843926986743982
. (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.	2.422967839412961
.	1.374839594702952
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	2.420273734419457
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	2.4124578130722982
That is positive.	2.7365575599361165
With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency.	2.010993962845783
Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law.	2.327254649654283
That is where we really get into difficulty.	2.282147411420186
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	3.0437842342308192
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	2.450917538807326
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	2.4906836502913623
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	2.4397585556838455
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.	2.2120842544731114
Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered.	2.5726859842000223
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	2.29148494776919
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.	2.5132027936118875
Ideally the European Parliament ' s representatives should be able to support Cuba ' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	2.1627762422691026
The European Parliament ' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation.	2.606853080091806
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.	2.3417191055620274
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.	2.1772787808445613
I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.	2.234717266659917
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	2.8970551490738736
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP.	2.0779815205940046
Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today ' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission ' s communications.	3.0099325744658167
We remain committed to eradicating the disease, an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector.	2.522308609814471
We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them.	2.1752971896413205
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	2.440102589482124
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain ' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.	1.5892682495696313
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.	2.856216591717905
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	1.6224132518925698
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	2.971306645590022
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.	2.917835957862586
Thirdly, unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time, tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes.	2.206896007567671
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	2.077574368178391
Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved.	1.7669788154966797
Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals?	2.2263469087177543
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights.	2.1754482051201762
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.	2.2211219774373596
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee.	2.2415195792115608
Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries ' .	1.9755116291033663
So, for example, the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	2.2357730832361735
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	2.8693704810229117
We need hard and fast rules.	2.935855563711475
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	2.355526135947745
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people. We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner.	2.8155803175952223
'Restore hope ' , do you remember?	1.4082745613674839
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.	2.6365214481987334
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	2.88082024800114
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament ' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate.	2.528106272009542
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	2.4859226394621836
That is also mentioned in the report.	2.320890382987957
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.	2.3445017969429736
Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work.	2.230442494837471
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.	2.001362143799099
. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.	2.868373750913518
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.	2.0782391426007747
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.	2.1912317614352887
Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans.	1.5980826101182846
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe.	2.796600145673844
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings.	1.9280835955678761
We asked for a whistle-blower ' s regulation, and this is now in place.	2.9926555419973826
However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project.	2.7478503860342167
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way.	2.772777584783239
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	1.8764076131502558
Report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)0344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)	1.9019403569648556
The EU ' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector.	2.733460022889565
In specific terms, we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations, at which this will be a central issue.	3.3309419921347407
Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there.	2.288792431153026
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission ' s communication is ill-considered.	2.060204894723452
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	1.8735170626524316
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution.	2.2952878316469008
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	2.3323309959533787
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.	2.130874434358508
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.	1.6552636771049731
There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen.	2.0851790523481
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens.	2.0988295290191616
At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position.	2.487878658543072
First of all: who should pay?	1.7715561188855582
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.	2.211858055661807
By now, my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice.	2.317435960260051
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.	2.0042529561719737
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	1.7128245306550656
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	2.126128282393576
On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government.	1.9460903695428635
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.	2.087563340762946
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion.	2.1639904879359695
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection.	3.1379936756855784
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.	2.5121817916938918
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter?	1.755771344307238
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.	2.7607320414424357
The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised.	2.7728937306011843
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	2.3242529954655033
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	2.4947202801416566
Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop.	1.8533535423542908
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.	2.6127709184975996
In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries.	1.9083112141279845
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	2.391193966951086
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	2.2612689460319384
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	1.7762956717294411
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	1.7303628901635837
Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe ' s role in the world.	2.379074573365121
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.	1.9010545307591495
Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation.	2.666495117765374
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.	1.8046114759396528
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.	2.429988786964064
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	3.3077181947902563
That is not always the case.	2.365215116341711
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.	2.510708036124199
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	2.3724285131741443
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.	2.6344828123955004
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.	2.4759539711622818
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution.	2.9734644541402475
Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.	1.4792825109819723
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way.	2.4950743347998907
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus.	2.3256127461959624
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level.	1.8984314533301732
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society ' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.	1.9135647292385685
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example.	3.0072089085075695
Chancellor Schüssel ' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	1.7649357550029976
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.	2.7309585295589938
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	2.1618503409910534
Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in.	2.396185471813638
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?	2.4374900249934406
Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.	2.058564053849191
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.	2.8482289847346616
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.	2.3265210450086977
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	2.35511758530009
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.	2.2401223731341036
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events.	1.9478222472085347
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years ' time.	1.9062333138269003
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	2.257582290568998
Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions.	2.5943634948911383
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings.	1.8993590356084358
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	2.254259018153809
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves?	2.6488024056378188
I respect Parliament ' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament.	2.9006448922722794
A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of.	2.193527615827119
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	2.2574892968533797
However, on this occasion, the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord.	2.6548197592221356
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty.	2.667009139604874
This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe.	2.556745380289037
Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures.	2.370539135137021
By definition, investment funds use other people ' s money.	2.139063933806616
Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.	1.9865768033096123
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this.	3.301947955996293
As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards.	1.9108181690990267
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	2.053396532024976
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.	2.463936990485899
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.	2.349070054364213
The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal.	2.6466209331586077
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	2.277921352973585
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against.	2.1608675763219654
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production.	1.9809717464328682
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	2.1074857515452354
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.	2.560554039699534
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country.	2.521801757855235
Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration.	1.9480288281651301
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	3.028292076651151
The Commission ' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point.	2.67580627896016
True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system.	2.437363661214329
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.	2.243056530780989
At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties.	2.283573892948936
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	2.774753660686984
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women ' s participation in the political decision-making process.	2.5017741097084554
Overall we have a system which has made some progress.	2.400926292221791
That concludes the debate.	1.9043701250864986
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.	2.24284082544723
Even more serious is the government ' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal.	2.0312802925818247
But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out.	1.7406770065729038
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.	2.545393886858378
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	2.2642651835477126
Report (A5-0069/1999) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999)0101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)	1.8140091819330297
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	1.9946595753632703
The German Government ' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.	2.040711990171434
Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	2.6201763579712445
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes.	2.390761354863673
As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.	2.842724330188803
In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme.	2.935457196210767
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average.	1.9253450928912978
Regarding the fight against organised crime, 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan, which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations, in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering. And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency ' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.	2.329709280662679
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	2.389561361105056
We are not talking about words here.	2.428414306588711
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	2.30055991224988
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.	1.9260476253819665
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping.	2.6301140869808197
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.	2.822291002871758
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	2.223790844814927
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.	3.0156421156057482
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	2.3982189142524812
Agenda	1.0773763300143226
When Sweden joined the European Union, it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States.	1.9016451039573516
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	2.251647567097234
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry.	2.329622687660656
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	2.6316882017709102
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	2.1906227761341945
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures.	2.4379971872299127
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words, and I quote, "of the highest possible standard" are replaced by "are safe" .	2.1023502436317645
We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.	2.2098382851621885
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	1.9091414094311856
The report that the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated.	2.599072903677753
A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS).	1.9386661726797314
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.	1.9467766466958114
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water.	2.3149854940799233
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now.	1.921326447737158
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level.	2.025539326674309
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day.	2.3706176462647464
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	2.5178796427782983
Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.	2.002918217479604
It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments.	1.9415447447029637
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	2.653979724910377
In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.	2.1593357773746367
Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one ' s own money for the purposes of one ' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.	2.294462279887585
Now, the concept of "uniform harmonisation" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security.	1.8538482009108415
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.	2.302064686532595
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution.	2.134099523300978
It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region.	2.1401037841434505
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.	1.9419502691671893
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	2.1379405402382976
We thank you for that.	4.110988659028781
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.	3.1164756854636404
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	1.9041318461305443
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard.	2.191800232420561
Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying.	2.549825046276007
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	2.3797536652995266
Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services.	2.147603687227011
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.	2.432547609510992
I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss.	1.8465443040205953
In this context, a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open.	2.6435886854334885
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	2.835985980675474
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council ' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	2.435774735759635
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened.	1.5115054891380146
Today, in many Member States, that is not possible.	2.624778747525217
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.	2.526235692147629
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	2.5085497006511783
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.	2.4249525328844808
In 1995, a five-year derogation period was decided upon, which is now lapsing.	2.3945093263733326
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.	2.147346693335987
Do not listen to the report ' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	2.139638825950674
Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question.	2.412037008457087
In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States ' national authorities.	2.979901444363207
Of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, while at the same time we deal very robustly with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon.	2.209683948296537
I would also like to make a more general point.	3.250875788179857
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	2.7037778951173688
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years.	2.6213738696497213
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	2.639509853559478
In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State ' s democratic process.	2.0691034696337773
These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period.	1.782790103426854
In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union ' s role in terms of copyright.	3.1830619028034457
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM ' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM ' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	2.1151593202184085
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.	2.785566412487962
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	2.525475876117008
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.	2.6532708024744864
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	1.78244364406083
In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop.	1.9746818550590943
But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies.	1.711444716672701
Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice?	1.975872201799736
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	2.6650079091220746
Lastly, in today ' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.	2.157643916926645
Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications.	1.4696603407703233
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system.	3.144066959458634
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	1.8306883993209164
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.	2.8505587179223584
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.	2.194406921125378
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	1.9374733390203907
It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now.	2.536520919607858
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.	1.8726992169466363
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	2.0802913311675235
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.	2.9688451702369054
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	2.3746709912612247
This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish.	1.988406706773091
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.1200597917622708
Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):	1.8126066334894742
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.	1.766658530050433
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.	1.7853149299692277
.	1.374839594702952
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community 's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	2.4705041422199914
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	2.697435623944476
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.	2.2915383510606766
No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared.	1.688893074123601
But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth.	2.2718081645947374
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament ' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	2.5945470395932526
I will keep myself free in this connection.	2.49545323521343
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them.	2.2808675517002137
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	2.1584027180826575
It is thus not confined to EC activities.	2.599784539918832
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	2.143018038911264
If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent, because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns.	2.520757102559168
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor.	1.6986360144570427
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	2.5195781433390048
It is never easy working on comitology.	2.509149230989558
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission ' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates.	2.070987044558603
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with all these major political challenges, but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway, we are also faced with major opportunities.	2.2573595337872847
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State, I must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone.	2.3589159766900716
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	2.0882986937373618
Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.	2.7182078007289006
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.	2.6525955921598108
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	2.093407674606644
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	2.6268019913014364
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	2.1049157280936632
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday.	2.365667363708595
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.	2.9028828301383145
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today?	3.81206046997312
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.	2.584957988713493
Adjournment of the session	1.14747099996588
We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable.	2.6978686924512423
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.	2.5367590922612484
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this!	2.1596221140778367
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	1.9993132475977027
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.	3.046519056236683
Aquaculture should also be monitored.	1.832151062886287
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.	2.0520691538297156
Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier.	1.8173964179315703
Mr President, I also rise on a point of order.	2.0640446942924457
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	1.810519993425564
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.	3.558735236547102
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.	3.533203716578334
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union.	2.4415415584079465
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million.	1.8683459624624996
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.	2.040148263964329
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.	1.6392152977723116
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.	2.274465289017547
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.	2.091149414448004
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.	1.6956916081179205
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999.	2.8002707993881994
Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context.	2.329654180413703
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	1.8656855329658357
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia.	2.271508333761813
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein ' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.	2.191241744368077
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.	2.4345191519960423
The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.	2.6194614653389614
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	2.407123847867116
In other words, when EU commercial interests are concerned, poverty considerations go out of the window.	2.1478231309412754
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	2.9648452516828327
Joint resolution on Austria	1.4996064985002264
Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse.	2.5438401698708706
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% .	2.7256623639090862
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union ' s competition policy.	2.781449828916603
Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress.	1.8978711628710543
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.	2.4996395990684555
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority.	2.0166845183612363
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission ' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	2.568179777357165
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds.	2.5817838757343323
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November.	2.795348599693558
Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference.	2.178790552036166
They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas.	1.755346252447843
Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action.	2.0911008742278803
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.	2.2278991244408135
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	2.2060837632227983
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.	2.171697147431674
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor ' s book.	1.6138796491171725
Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union.	2.539802942559723
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised.	2.2139722977995095
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	3.3796267385364103
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development.	2.489749277073925
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	2.3209250180879812
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	1.832761615555939
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves.	2.348758232927874
Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote.	2.1269919369064807
But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised.	1.6654541758069328
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered.	2.3163136113006826
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern.	2.155516062408885
This is why this report is so important.	2.7494118919461834
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are.	1.8593679326083916
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.	3.075077926758221
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real.	2.9543279864142336
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	1.85247594074097
The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds.	2.8643523711886463
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures, in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities.	2.7523577200467453
The delays in the Commission ' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.	2.525916175405388
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	2.5118675534550325
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	1.695687957824411
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission ' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.	2.3896514977800396
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.	2.464181821370631
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	2.3744796306876377
The same can be said with regard to transfers.	3.736230095939305
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	2.891212031449582
Things could well continue in the same way.	1.571468585779473
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law.	2.924539427512
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did.	2.209922311346733
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	2.5326123415273285
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	2.930760643854998
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	2.1397110771380388
To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.	2.0660255481070866
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba.	1.9072794672371245
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group ' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	2.424360582270272
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.	2.089704385710031
Floods in Mozambique	1.3842959313386147
Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right.	1.5695856886959885
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	2.264576585518108
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström ' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness.	2.2432121519733346
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.	1.8959099655288756
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	2.501877212590253
Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.	2.015755184347549
Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking.	2.36454113193043
Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms.	1.9720354917494676
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.	2.7979402264307582
VOTE (continuation)	1.7923218875694633
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.	2.2858331427620255
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	2.104200498504323
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol.	2.9036311977870675
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.	2.1829045392858237
In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars.	2.485006669959095
The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this.	2.4201948518307828
. Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday.	2.5342939135605502
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability.	1.5993755271625973
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit.	1.6110677005097478
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.	2.81975703323636
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann ' s work on this matter.	2.5793094785672133
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.	2.228441435787624
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.	2.996285244414808
To this end, I shall confine myself to stressing, out of all the choices available, the importance of three priority decisions which should, in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission ' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months.	2.597970648713945
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.	3.1089650003034404
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.	2.058298205528085
This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.	1.903572168139282
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.	2.3924998507368853
This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government.	2.102325978484786
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project.	2.41568524765309
However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.	2.0590974874926458
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.	2.2860490181773594
The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities.	2.0652327836804276
The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community.	3.125823635001998
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	1.8465840805206568
I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds.	2.4277326258824066
I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.	1.99011544953544
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	1.8421447352426223
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.	2.229890257838484
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.	2.195331616361874
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.	2.3539346125614236
Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria.	1.8560716070565257
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	2.243872385628955
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	2.3990598736786457
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this.	3.2275434333395836
In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether.	2.1813397516320396
We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up.	2.518491939407053
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	1.9587876932570754
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)	1.3544372220243563
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.	2.0177019454017193
There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part.	2.4144159905977136
I cannot think of a better way to do it.	2.9065620444150513
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	1.7775345325270728
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	2.9697600121704193
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .	2.4640377761914456
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us.	2.569137171736903
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal.	3.3185326705659373
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000 ' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	2.281615287245639
Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.	2.157902536410903
Mr President, today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.	2.565899063848645
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.	2.660580808743677
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	2.5456915277504883
As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day.	2.158141626957468
In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.	1.92969056373734
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	2.01035356720907
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.	2.591412893837093
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.	2.335386162899879
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	2.0130149607573617
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	2.325566364333812
Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann ' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council ' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice.	2.1106937538428068
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.	2.604018356626925
Not a euro more or a euro less.	1.8276600128410665
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	2.7474368462864938
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.	1.7501957545532714
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.	2.6794866494766345
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures.	1.871001509941484
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.	2.802154477789889
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue.	1.8283097860863362
The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff.	2.540422485500005
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	2.1387265064997845
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.	2.022998189425721
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	2.0277583122259695
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.	1.7251565893355438
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	2.1923902525871903
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.	2.9351011208771376
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	2.2579276728447635
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	2.067149507834944
The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs.	3.0351700712830643
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made.	2.3943045928009274
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.	3.604606096534534
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	2.081026733541365
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.	1.7967062968603562
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China ' s Communist Party.	1.9666383241729954
I hope we can have further debates like this.	2.6235036554315685
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	2.002011955110861
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want.	2.755276722702588
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	1.9794786752367488
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.	1.7162679710199749
I want to see civil society given a louder voice.	2.884768857217772
This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.	2.9902559924486605
However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence.	2.9228454944011384
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	2.4312031558425575
Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.	2.4348300846939406
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission ' s own survey among 3000 European businesses.	2.5520018384837804
I would also like to stress, as many Members have highlighted, that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe ' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union.	2.364905306208408
Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town.	1.3892298860512737
All this is important.	2.0752497908504255
And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people ' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.	2.15370753140429
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward.	2.5486546014332
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	1.3033216950966091

In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	2.22715408412157
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.	1.765294604605832
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	3.3156471695747527
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.	1.9854200633249097
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	1.9250115121496645
I have given you my answer.	2.9357235245672086
Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines.	2.200807778593892
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	1.7880256464988002
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points.	2.4926295355624806
I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt "extremist" amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers.	2.393277744829939
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France 's refusal to lift the ban?	2.161191931083159
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	2.5825922748769505
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	3.0050249377000275
What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.	2.5922273228868056
Frassoni Report (A5-0021/2000)	1.3536628466657705
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.	1.8584085902810392
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	2.2458929597138932
We are to get the agendas.	3.1519428374336633
I might never have studied otherwise.	3.0359756055952487
Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.	2.7235003313311275
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	2.5183260474651754
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks.	2.4427635440224837
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs.	1.73536558285153
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.	2.253884296570086
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.	2.3265741319656303
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.	2.245519177391199
The Commission did not do that.	3.0761802414323345
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.	2.9355514718930946
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	2.240165672948882
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."	2.1204386432096323
I think that, with this report, we are, once again, one step closer to the realisation of the internal market.	2.2157309574424566
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	2.258183387135849
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union.	2.222077137011997
We need a framework of regulations at international level.	2.7176978422579583
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.	1.6832853750734158
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.	2.343395297187293
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	2.1453363424993928
In particular, we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission ' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do (see, for example, paragraph 7).	2.540023398650532
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.	2.6734813926099403
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States.	2.2623832850529206
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	2.441022900811687
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	2.5758666034536057
Will it discuss the matter?	1.892628209412605
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	2.007815224783841
My question to the Commissioner is this: what is to be done?	3.1077476286162944
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	2.371727575373066
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged.	2.07498130886552
It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it.	2.371086144680875
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	2.1591477232273557
And there are more and more of us in the world.	2.7793156774737255
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid.	3.1189973050862325
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	2.351186298700218
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.	2.556444742032403
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	2.5768372708305614
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct.	3.2100841021351756
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.	2.6152068997703983
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	3.117115640099466
I do not think so.	2.629998118581199
Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.4502286573480636
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.	2.6508901705593515
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne ' s question.	2.750424946558344
This will determine the success of our work.	2.967962813312829
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development.	2.4710427142585747
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.	2.660510673378524
1997 discharge	1.575892579896805
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.	3.622220488922956
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	1.8698352948983534
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.	2.686526166984838
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.	2.473380643494676
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	1.7823138071023605
I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.	2.649505455693619
Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it?	1.9944451008703357
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar.	2.022085556953592
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.	2.41327501313063
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten ' s report.	2.2556657484914053
These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain.	2.090678097814446
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	1.6862296942661457
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	2.086881714575915
That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.	2.402357929173865
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough.	2.54545998169223
In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid.	2.085604432991192
That is the measure of the problem.	2.1353971826550833
Just a few main points.	1.695178670714782
Happy Valentine ' s Day!	1.548435812358822
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	2.968926704205608
Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee.	2.25387852757014
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.	3.729193108942181
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now.	2.619682361526327
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked.	2.3777674024553046
It is fine, in principle.	2.6404324676993394
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.	3.2422149550115535
And yet our President is a fine economist.	2.234073143523732
More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well.	1.6127394462442777
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	1.9220320240609845
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.	2.1882994518752876
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	2.4908306962079694
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	1.9535338049314832
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added.	2.160128301631254
Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding 'the language ' of the guest member state, especially when there are various official languages, and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages.	1.8585503362555496
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic.	2.474007933984613
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.	2.5728778178547436
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.	1.686794585121002
We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle.	2.4474843598610976
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings.	2.39515489892626
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service.	2.6519063437519406
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	2.3642964774969264
Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy.	1.761109139746441
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	2.7941122171792347
The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will, on the contrary, be supporting a number of amendments, especially those tabled by the Greens.	3.118427912145929
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	2.582288598054585
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.	3.149009323369916
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?	1.9744990214343747
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	2.1136194187423016
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe.	2.281914739704255
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement.	3.0547643172047034
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.	2.0157709213331843
But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us.	2.6388527410230416
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45.	2.252327098672924
Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually.	1.5943962090505277
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.	2.395522681547025
It is about brominated flame retardants.	2.558440101620589
In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy.	1.911164263164395
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	2.402705702058144
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.	1.735021329931302
The laws against racism must be harmonised.	2.8648610591810106
I would ask you once again to work on this.	3.042219607233133
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.	2.4086068812981467
(SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson ' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	1.863851476300323
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit.	2.1311741873996017
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work.	2.1577149732868053
The two processes are separate processes.	2.9448804205786816
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.	2.316300450068787
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.	2.9802541700208707
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	2.6383409863603924
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	2.419742240817805
It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage.	1.9181307003708394
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	2.3523111941857215
What we need here is good government, Madam President.	1.8887478128803563
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals.	2.145127716321789
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.	1.9830321809500102
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	2.1582702792619677
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	2.1022741195168497
The postal service is also the doctor.	3.3016192754494553
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	2.3751188471795563
Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics.	2.258395648636444
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management.	2.6379509432412744
Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support.	2.084144866639029
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets. In three or four days, this can equal the total figure of annual global production, or global GDP, of approximately EUR 6 000 billion.	1.5873441187719035
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation.	2.1518978676620626
This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate.	2.034332726116298
It is a report which tries to give direction.	2.4670884579395804
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	2.2871590470826426
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.	2.281751098617163
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	2.88417296591237
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed.	2.761478116404329
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	2.445631792866763
No, you have not done so.	2.2402365991164697
In other words, it is positive discrimination.	2.5151405508863722
When the Commission ' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	2.329523492512501
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	2.5116286120639044
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	2.469163199553807
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	1.4555344430722206
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?	2.374301942689737
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	3.452989981624706
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU.	2.4015381409409255
They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin.	1.957937261767185
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.	2.1936991621024995
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	1.9318553472328208
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.	2.6882056507957763
Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy.	1.8818560424296922
The main point is that the money for Cyprus ' s and Malta ' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December.	2.545784796783321
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever.	2.4005151769395527
As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so.	2.189809425340835
This kind of tourism, which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens, is just as important.	2.166563212933157
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	2.601168342320145
Parliament has no equivalent power.	2.075005799059814
Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland ' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others.	2.4925252123098813
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council.	2.1892263854887104
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	1.309724901730238
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.	2.6586957079358045
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	2.501224457359158
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people ' s health and the environment.	2.781401341460003
They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.	2.3319319019173794
Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.	2.1209625927431244
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?	2.0021071051201864
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	2.7768219076162426
As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law.	2.0833464466854856
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	2.025826002154043
The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak ' s Government.	1.8167717106744148
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission 's reform proposals.	2.6397809358878264
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	2.548814755930367
LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget, and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years. Despite the enlargement which has already taken place, when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second, despite enlargement, the level of appropriations remained the same.	2.116644018849666
On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.	1.969419856394283
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	1.9993783521377448
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika ' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	1.8926198262012965
For example, the LIFE-Nature project in France, at Grand-Lieu Lake, planned without any coordination, led to a real ecological disaster, the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau, a water course located downstream, destroying spawning beds, filling wetlands, and who knows what else.	1.6885556871169232
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.	2.6157582683717937
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission ' s report.	3.270364558066877
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands.	2.6781306237724234
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	1.8133345846981344
It is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	2.1531749879552353
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.	2.48726247665449
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level.	2.123802629364481
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	1.687413165213516
But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes.	2.0508537578380643
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	2.733829381482495
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions.	2.2007196844858212
However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management ' s attitude is socially irreprehensible.	2.094355818629047
We also need to criticise the Commission ' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	2.256154373988401
This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries ' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community ' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited.	1.896913951804565
In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is de facto a move in the right direction.	2.1988672385635604
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.935748292827478
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	3.472133096233022
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	1.8908445724108112
It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament ' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.	2.4355099341993767
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	1.4757882911900164
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.	2.019270886025068
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	2.066111589265277
Mr President, I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs ' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece.	2.465100263081723
Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped.	1.7098729193687945
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	1.9028060261541726
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.	2.5494319330588326
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	2.389467014910203
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	3.0144500682856386
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	1.727123469657661
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.	2.472911019029075
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	2.6488162425359447
I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect.	2.834317001870423
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.	2.157483370028184
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.	2.2457081178631233
It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden ' s.	1.8582634092305672
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	2.5665785117336903
I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy.	2.236977116130216
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor ' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	2.43418200547859
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe ' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.	3.001608456792272
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	2.04952376209469
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);	1.7437386865524842
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities.	1.8123358630143283
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	3.135505880921872
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.	1.7888267061528693
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	1.850528044676766
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management.	2.265996383567202
We must therefore act.	3.2669141065495486
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	3.0306557347997165
Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals.	2.532299185415769
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	2.17712274500314
The Council therefore, has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty.	2.4062153865750253
Indeed, it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources.	2.325605469129464
In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers.	1.7320923218988358
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	1.9526406363257873
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations.	2.0380047458219877
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.	1.7680176246005919
On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market.	2.0775437152888196
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.	2.432831149482108
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	2.98375521062793
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.	1.6431955605989967
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	3.0088743602523618
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework.	2.1207341668669475
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	2.451021936107899
This is all I can say today.	2.937077352664588
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome.	2.6242006567274694
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	2.0490454441220685
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	2.1359986348304107
Never have the parties been so determined.	1.6352019199581305
This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. We now hope to be able to solve these problems.	2.6317866778504944
It also contains four calls to the Member States which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs, particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments. These would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively, such as the tourist sector.	2.4569886433441583
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle.	2.139752184858923
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned.	3.2223128154711156
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication.	2.5888585414731144
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	1.3612297527948254
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	2.0650248960038695
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	2.530124103150952
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.	2.1827727544649567
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.	3.1379131209674616
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.	3.287037104570887
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	2.100858317388423
Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity.	2.205635808658047
They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation.	3.124937189348527
Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism.	1.7140154519490385
When an autonomous region 's or country 's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.	1.8175841694357167
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure.	2.132581021468857
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	2.264681519344734
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission ' s White Paper.	3.0707612574862675
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough.	2.2742708651631705
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	2.0723142448550345
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.	2.4037703145489617
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.	1.932381103350332
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	2.040758632665785
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.	1.9357553386181612
Personally, however, I shall continue to fight against the extreme right, to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria, and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m.	1.9188392733340591
I await with interest developments in Cuba.	2.834697873878807
We must win back their faith in EU politics.	2.378856595278419
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	2.140974167256587
Human rights	1.686365074019992
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.	1.9834802957701418
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	3.6721718888308867
Thank you for your statement.	2.002449151999837
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio ' s Amendment No 22 in both respects.	2.218100206907617
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	2.6029777836555437
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor ' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	2.4208449455677434
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	1.6200293935318124
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen.	1.9255891240069087
But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this.	2.5229701753440428
The important thing is for money to generate more money.	2.5155145779831436
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	3.0174947291516787
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.	2.1207790645285987
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out.	1.9958284025337456
Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.	2.4181875635364265
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	2.2037053999662795
In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important.	2.7040989590231876
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.	3.433821483194405
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.	3.298693170389404
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace.	2.3332303409511863
Here, in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact, it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a plan which is now being finalised, and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States, in Moscow, and to develop a set of further initiatives.	2.4570931587368037
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect.	2.644937137076868
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	2.623905159495151
Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland.	1.4394668246600926
In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric.	2.4534785658038585
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU ' s overall agricultural policy.	2.488980491121981
These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion.	2.5047025074814333
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	2.0576755804933256
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission ' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	1.9984681311297212
Firstly, there is the Commissioners ' individual responsibility.	2.038605338374056
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	2.2724851472199568
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all.	2.282361042302203
Well, I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information, and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it, then we will have bad decisions.	2.419189697828095
There was no majority for this at the time.	2.3947617366981495
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory.	1.9568010338091675
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said.	1.8715257810378991
I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening.	2.546976879506543
Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.	1.9221041836904644
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	2.089696362071279
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.	2.6633985523675197
First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed.	1.7289429013388289
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health.	1.9293043025935315
In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of "Ten Commandments" : a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points.	2.3318124472070063
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there.	2.6155243531404073
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.	3.0020533930020084
Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine.	2.2702059096253566
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.	2.020533606226481
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government?	2.182427527698271
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	1.9368486719176317
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	2.1518922537462215
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	2.4723711549680742
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	2.502945323823688
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	1.8040050411249606
More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.	2.291462985263388
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	2.2073906598304704
Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy.	1.9345220432103363
That concludes the vote	2.537317588266348
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.	2.306726758313496
What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme?	2.4358818588818902
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	2.458456012731743
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.	3.1209479157002313
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle ' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	2.0944557713375214
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	2.393525475020082
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 100, can economically compete within this very challenging environment.	2.4399335629112593
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach.	1.966667284066434
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	2.253887513849166
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies.	2.070403479974375
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country ' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	1.8427008704605523
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on.	2.6991543008005143
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.	2.182204191478755
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.	2.345285820690169
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000, the date promised by Ehud Barak?	1.4711812385680045
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	1.9330550090176686
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.	2.209434121240565
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.	2.4292738239156266
Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment.	1.7348052818327404
If not, we will be fighting a running battle.	2.627165447373974
We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning.	2.818702769416116
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed.	2.4916507017409955
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	2.213296964888761
Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme.	2.0482286880666956
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	2.9668660770077713
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.	2.3134357396606218
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	2.5244214207175184
Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning.	2.7450956811975695
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.	2.2503145267323568
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe ' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.	2.49887226433273
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	2.3984430717994973
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	2.532585845742832
I am glad to see that the Commission and Parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area.	2.6972968171787173
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority 's establishment.	2.309957439197643
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism.	2.5458894549660256
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.	1.6605588059776861
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.	2.3650041320968964
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	1.7686635945690627
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	2.498522678780165
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	2.256144311253947
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	2.4118257522997535
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	2.1743913133886488
Mr President, before I came here for today ' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.	2.3588007448882653
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
Unfortunately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer.	1.9686571989951491
Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour.	2.1944315339759584
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	2.9577671435587303
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met.	2.6141999095969966
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	2.663347733139013
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	2.4436662496489903
As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry.	1.710909188797732
Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.	2.365203625898764
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.	2.7251678158187875
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals.	2.2506044884421637
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	2.3278842057484193
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.	2.3854037447832144
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority.	1.913446789178653
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.	2.233207569303638
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	2.1196876507478972
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.	2.1833184813135578
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned.	2.477943430940552
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	2.905503144501398
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.	2.551350177733317
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.	2.703899119731197
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.	2.233537362137063
The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data.	2.3653751987865173
Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates.	1.8705630110083984
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	2.0157850766986467
For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children ' s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries.	2.2865950918951823
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	2.100522011370242
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	2.4859286561510427
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House.	2.473849246152153
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity.	3.962488712936838
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	3.050337911740363
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	2.5051532942368664
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	2.9371818172873314
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	1.918654058482408
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.	2.28251560452965
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	2.105089264627508
- (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition.	2.112960111609138
Thank you, Mr Murphy.	2.143733076686093
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten 's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	2.666855943137116
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	2.7292330782583725
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	4.050339099785165
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen.	1.8792541675082985
It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.	2.165410758148799
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words.	2.7694639772028946
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission ' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	3.019280108115612
We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.	2.3159356400197733
Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results, and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation.	1.9954538135098465
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.	2.3299193210281923
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	2.548834221488253
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory.	1.8488304807092009
And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development.	2.38864125207787
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	2.516526286425266
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.	2.0718539881737708
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	2.1342382286628916
What do we expect from a government in any case?	2.2359150386863447
I am, moreover, proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council.	2.3158844444854583
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	1.871660198939878
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.	2.635262875811348
Absolutely, I do not think that will pose a problem.	1.9505715253176887
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds.	2.193882841433917
On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	2.164850838398365
For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.	1.8955652237865077
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	2.171475523105426
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.	2.5586371380377733
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China.	2.397833910251641
The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China.	2.4839207160532655
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks.	2.5766655642731147
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised?	1.6755307005728908
Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider ' s Freedom Party.	2.0862136364458572
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate.	2.568753133061226
While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun, I think it is important to keep the two processes apart.	2.2276599263704826
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement.	3.1741414133864954
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .	1.5640237831104884
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	2.223388203868536
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted.	2.6088390272201294
Rapid action is called for!	1.506100123277543
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence.	2.234358479266353
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.	1.866921157345124
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.	2.3825882401900045
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources.	2.5337993015037283
My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.	2.4333508877252976
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d ' être, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.	2.5164502247407703
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	2.3195419341546533
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes.	2.274351008404143
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	1.867861733871572
By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying ' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.	2.0950479913291016
This report is about the Commission.	3.1935628852884705
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.	2.3305424529278054
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them.	2.2161147405616437
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.	2.9846504476155595
Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today ' s agenda. We decided on Monday that the Council ' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed.	2.4697423329213506
I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do.	2.130520690034247
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	2.4196720293414846
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	2.114781479165104
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue.	2.0397710059650134
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	1.600670908735408
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	1.9776632346560319
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief.	2.513059013163262
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.	2.617485423869581
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty.	2.65573057321571
More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right.	1.9750910414021923
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union ' s cultural policy activities once again.	2.735470448471792
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.	2.702545051275994
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.	1.9197995082042716
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	2.65666485988082
On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party.	1.9077007401011772
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.	1.8673301886354556
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control.	2.0196698108901976
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.	2.1503109523481885
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure	1.4670840395904838
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	2.3178947880856335
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	2.2431299082531355
Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III.	2.4354529754404743
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.	2.322350506969946
This is reasonable and we support this, but we have to ask the Commissioner, why not Africa?	3.0888362579893474
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	2.166436813869881
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.	2.5199305451221066
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	1.6094296767589524
Those could perpetuate an infection.	1.7775201102124645
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.	2.6320151170628656
Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.	2.1425507852848362
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed.	3.239678718435122
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.	2.42237339195591
The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems.	2.1776808642822254
We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable.	2.175628857726453
How do you think a system like that would affect people ' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	1.9579887246937735
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.	2.053747563748331
Because they have fewer opportunities.	1.773265732473798
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.	2.2227889286638702
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	2.4299699961466006
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue.	1.7000980860795714
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today ' s debate.	2.414109027508458
I think ours is a different approach!	3.038723669492327
The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	1.9839111998690917
The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	2.2167381823682577
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment.	1.8901333638098219
I will give you one example of this.	2.541960604160214
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	2.3348953789077442
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo ' s speech set here.	2.5219968333300944
We believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention, but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation.	2.6990683654845578
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	1.6762023449927537
If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.	2.1415862667899934
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.	2.228170839032676
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	2.449081719297766
Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus.	2.503147085841694
But what were the Commission ' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	2.069481116153591
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour ' s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof.	1.7495371729658789
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.	2.603850283968857
It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.	2.593048471677212
.	1.374839594702952
This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat.	2.348769711659106
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.	1.7374244078307401
Madam President, we simply have a few translation problems in this area too.	2.4558254784818603
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	1.9617657314078132
(Loud applause)	1.0445699450791264
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	1.552933436427488
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.	2.2300888007549005
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.	2.0740699647670504
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs.	2.6182843882507396
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.	2.4464727116043306
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.	2.018218373092965
That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council.	2.3083812828102594
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	2.2821492240707832
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention.	2.9711544612232124
This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government.	1.9365399553709877
It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration ' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended.	2.144113930237657
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.	2.679047377547456
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis.	2.226858542527662
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period. This is not very good at all.	2.549741354662153
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today.	2.382836040373142
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.	2.232595921763114
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.	2.5459947002979813
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	2.142572727079456
It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks.	1.817878729832719
The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.	2.1180441247551007
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector.	2.1411417441735607
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	2.2546768386547247
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.	2.9599558515191875
A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think.	1.7644212903257646
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary.	2.5484359738778704
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	1.8959100566294378
Report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)	1.771861622286256
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	2.170267843693404
Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment.	2.6053181112624815
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	2.367866109000342
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	2.33455026035407
. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	1.7957809926729562
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence.	2.2027080284205556
Opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe: "This Directive would be unfair since, for example, the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples ".	1.6468479427079277
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	2.292302172047345
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.	1.9793681488916246
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	2.196224791976794
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	2.0285136277037976
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	1.9909060984889333
I agree with your analysis.	3.3214980669591836
Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set.	2.0686220390686554
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price.	2.238439726815591
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	2.2061945038207855
If this is not to be a mere media event, it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee, the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed.	3.221233474841155
We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors.	2.3075789469959638
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	2.2589423141032925
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism, and not just the economic and financial policy experts.	2.2766226282999025
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.	2.007527357541092
These amendments can all be approved.	2.3552555691609496
It should prevent society from splintering.	2.6476000475019403
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation.	3.2432993219591895
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	1.7461882525389012
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative.	3.160705944748246
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.	2.551129636136351
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%.	1.9515939780765041
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?	1.480496814873027
As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia.	2.080131567788301
The pattern of intimidation is clear.	2.8646883913209154
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished.	2.46034272757258
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	2.1621465031189717
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success.	2.2849101338502806
We need to clarify the liability for transactions.	2.7147742277529527
However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market.	2.2241892426390764
Let us be honest.	2.220260537159228
In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is a matter which we are currently dealing with.	2.571327099861803
Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.	1.929740620655097
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	2.2649657401911063
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.	2.344827312381589
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	2.231917399115722
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria ' s.	3.2061199009385213
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.	3.092786707390534
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)	1.3741792939403366
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	2.461610536502688
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf ' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report.	2.538209728391553
Mr President, yesterday ' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.	2.450820112729687
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	2.1555021666230427
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.	2.3247170724020805
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.	2.4698769517222234
Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes.	1.8295834305950125
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid.	3.313696701824722
To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us.	2.066116209480583
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	2.3896469766577946
However, I would just like to add the following.	2.689741350470366
That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old.	2.005740641465697
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	2.093083440051085
No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private.	1.9619337577614058
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content.	2.129869528274263
Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion.	2.1478185402649577
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.	1.9094067450251286
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.	2.4140558986425944
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again.	2.6887982701927426
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	2.482475334771113
In order to do so, it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordinating body to implement a 'Women and Science ' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women ' s participation in research activities.	2.086106663572717
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the "jewel in the crown" of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.3515190711570835
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse.	2.1535209628482876
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika.	2.3005293885985525
I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum.	2.6505162994645795
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.	1.8751000328477694
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	2.407515984060748
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.	2.211589681639224
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	2.3401367025565483
It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann ' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position.	2.505239686593838
Is this right and proper?	2.1730459484539675
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	2.4265895970109943
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.	2.0744436576817367
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree.	1.9091362409206205
However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers.	2.549212609640434
Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level.	1.8404514582652245
Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.	1.7338435179465908
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	1.6482845137571833
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment	1.4883255853761248
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	2.4272095741788817
Within the third CSF, this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee.	2.07953592806597
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	1.9821912532354264
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	3.076018931193985
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	2.797304769484973
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe ' s common heritage.	2.7152284291030377
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	2.6224359663070174
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention.	2.9605016720381596
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	1.813681190493667
It is his first report here in plenary.	2.410755755769762
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	2.4937232654422754
The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget.	2.589384113450933
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4.	2.7562617730797654
Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	2.092607956971688
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	2.878982404694611
A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines.	2.318296769738742
The internal market is the basis for our work.	3.6595063566050463
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.	2.0611662098029933
I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council.	2.3088702598960764
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.	1.821547299819897
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union.	2.727473191851924
I hope that this will be of benefit.	3.555849639226271
On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States.	1.6800290516342595
I propose that we start the debate immediately.	2.7760463637143653
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.	2.1025727357286392
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	1.8332850560141483
Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council.	2.4122982110017244
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People ' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok ' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda ' s report were brought forward in the agenda.	2.374748566137647
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.	2.3002709016493905
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	1.986667149099653
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.	2.0025466585796634
However, Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats.	1.8412878526256151
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	2.4563194272660964
Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs.	1.7352585876016524
So further thought is necessary.	2.192653269589646
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.	2.1652390205764114
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.	2.3115954766303703
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals.	2.519540673252905
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.	2.8709779329728335
All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.	2.4470072489911288
I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin.	2.8261347416602436
I would ask for that to be checked again.	2.7677569162122073
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.	2.0056790709469268
Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie ' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year.	2.816501763938537
The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)].	1.8894291897925084
Madam President, today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles.	2.5995763222022847
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes.	1.6801449012237757
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	2.269563335529207
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?	2.4882724359954986
We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	3.178105990538885
The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.	3.051933106916292
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.	1.989571332987534
If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason.	1.9943977777467943
President.	1.2448676067253313
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	1.620295298216535
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.	2.6477883000906672
It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.	1.9123533058148294
Mr President, Mr Alavanos ' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues.	1.9922111194934138
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union ' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	2.3190437651917257
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	3.2470966060023825
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	2.5787347808727548
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	1.9364629941219544
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	2.354641688572047
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	2.5406140396061083
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge.	2.085453753427114
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	2.133768465866676
rapporteur.	1.2779470400184048
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	2.4748355160653053
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people ' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission ' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	2.447476007964014
But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself.	3.1828593696970304
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	2.613602501829636
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	1.8424193240490594
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.	2.5838832562493637
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?	2.331102084017579
We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed.	2.029927789607707
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly.	2.0126499627462713
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	2.6319224848454805
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.	2.5073303637325557
This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation.	3.1517115880160986
Why am I stressing this point?	1.9840545260031768
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	2.0390053179241834
We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.	2.3953987825890586
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	2.3210032168576604
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.	1.6158787645808144
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	2.8876865221877366
That did not happen.	3.0756727346978137
The disease is always fatal.	3.5758678912323565
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner.	2.9442118326262547
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect.	1.4276136596130307
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.	2.8634054709413648
The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage.	2.3164894849355435
That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas.	2.0392843631950357
This is all I can say.	2.630762106113254
My country ' s place is not outside the European Union but in it .	3.0130830757038796
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)	1.580182179458229
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	1.827245915653764
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits.	2.1596310828946628
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2).	2.933366792993793
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	2.4596054017784637
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	2.9833125421595925
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year ' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	1.7018125003420708
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	1.8036243098568967
That concludes Questions to the Council.	2.2295569481706763
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	2.1167602016723546
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	3.0996360255711917
As Vaclav Havel rightly said today, the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual.	2.5120708831100678
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources.	2.729393466422975
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.	2.2864656300744333
I would like to comment on two things. Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes.	2.298628670080885
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	2.639237646736028
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	2.0127652629712958
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	2.377429029604482
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda.	2.7016102048922606
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.	2.2166602774516293
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	2.214953256396006
Coherence of EU policies with development	1.6015278436629867
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	2.330090514038921
And since this is St. Valentine ' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	2.5144933321965586
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory.	2.4847324187222064
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union.	1.943348043672826
I know that this service is unprofitable.	2.911894097668869
Cyprus should be one sovereign state, with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised.	1.586634675110355
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock ' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	2.6764648973369334
The people of Angola deserve better.	2.916858299381962
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider ' s Freedom Party.	1.9106004215673207
Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous.	2.0083465575148334
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	2.3430849755894196
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible.	1.9046799231794107
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition.	2.3297408857073227
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	2.5517277007484984
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.	2.467694073904818
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.	1.7055530972304846
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	2.0326071380961483
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats.	2.61312686359817
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	1.9168541558372776
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.	2.369607258865552
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.	2.063906340463056
Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was.	2.029498580218676
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.	2.6305246432179277
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	3.2620357617711626
Appropriate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate.	1.7514799078096825
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.	2.0713116543310557
When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth.	2.0828953361116476
It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency.	2.4090479314044737
One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance.	2.4234235956118986
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	2.060941658219682
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	2.8415230524051487
End-of-life vehicles	1.334923379736335
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.	2.387927729900794
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	1.87076363975836
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.	1.9908076060533244
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	2.696342871607373
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists.	2.636171083909254
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	1.9938788889359094
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector.	2.488016907389802
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.	2.4319712268452722
I condemn Jörg Haider ' s racist and xenophobic policy.	3.080872824808545
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission ' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	2.5162745798001738
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.	3.0930562882535457
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	2.413788170614822
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive.	2.044913281854049
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.	1.7433473520050464
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	1.99829206967967
The problems in Europe ' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	2.384028421097504
Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.	1.8236251314649816
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	3.6792805370046997
We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim.	2.0045453050552453
The partnership between the European Union and the ACP was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium.	2.9657905788987855
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	2.1090039728336976
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.	2.5993935145407363
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola.	2.50975689318065
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.	2.0440857460000665
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	1.877311548675853
I do not believe this to be the case. The reason for this decision was, rather, that we wanted to have a special instrument for the Eastern and Central European States which, like Malta and Cyprus, are involved in the accession process, but under different conditions.	2.4024518893433005
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.	2.9158592822044014
It regards tourism for senior citizens.	2.7497987362812117
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds.	2.332426653232297
This question needs to be resolved urgently.	4.05085319730209
We adopt legislation in the European Union.	3.2479502488041208
Nevertheless, we believe, and I think this is also how the Commission sees things, that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European Union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible. It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession, as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions.	2.5492367198469204
Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes.	1.7370760053136838
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	2.3774715522823864
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.	2.7050502009823942
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.	1.9485227902263418
Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament.	2.92629666556403
But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman.	2.413909969517502
Transport of dangerous goods by road	1.861923699471639
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	2.883131905498753
You did not call me either.	2.10830726001266
-	2.0184696698254547
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	2.1463123901149377
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	2.1325858750584334
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	2.6508150556818193
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	2.567427774211714
Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice.	2.2201289261831962
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.	1.9404195151721366
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.	2.512812338853665
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.	1.899198127525682
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	2.231359970208347
But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland.	2.015445052519769
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?	2.3971610214219967
We must clearly set firm objectives.	2.665476073596347
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	2.2375541786188307
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.	2.5407958875646472
What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	1.8910535036648797
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	2.560835588904074
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	2.8043296846710097
When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.	2.3248292188845827
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	2.0387731994112235
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening.	2.065756871421903
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect.	2.7733540418108795
This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people.	2.3696409084968515
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	1.991555405100519
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	2.0753157492849605
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	2.2427337800327782
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	2.469490895889473
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):	1.823920024070336
This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission ' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies.	3.1278102076362444
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does?	2.1355013732163792
We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair and considerate use of water.	2.4585716766070997
VOTE	1.0850475141586433
I know that this is somewhat controversial, particularly, because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime.	3.036446767211719
Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative.	2.791151765483008
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	2.217878927581864
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.	2.20664438086618
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas.	2.5407479437050027
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission ' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.	2.4693719242393004
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	1.9313952652726945
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	1.9600416796283697
Mr President, the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.	2.0953801481247334
In Europe, in your rapporteur ' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.	2.214761765338885
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	2.150523238545143
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	2.264852375950632
Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament.	2.017762713887446
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.	2.0266111375970257
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission ' s original proposal.	2.8749147591425284
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner?	1.8214510952560232
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime.	2.3937180821944883
In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today.	1.9618236213504834
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	2.0808079312813206
The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased.	2.7878923378546627
This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.	2.5400859455383906
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.	2.106010454551404
Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility.	2.272517648452489
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.	2.6765761919094304
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.	2.372859182968404
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy.	1.650243860699396
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	1.766964288287046
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown.	1.757923223139543
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine.	1.3977691182909668
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.	2.762852145001235
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone 's standards.	1.7701109159881727
Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level.	3.296352291314248
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships ' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.	1.8547604958404584
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	2.404751340382276
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	2.149307782585344
Another example is cacao.	2.051554736250922
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	1.967526839511273
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?	2.4002350734954527
It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase?	2.2988304993043545
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.	2.731876091906906
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	2.278841668924111
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	2.1808382908149166
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame.	2.3172171207835848
. (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer.	1.8027112128487222
This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland.	2.6201575968260298
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	1.8120342507496972
But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species.	2.160416176801997
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	2.37214819327467
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	1.8453169410017694
Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission.	2.4374743625457462
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important.	3.5746764695752598
They are still in training, as it were.	2.3109829764254934
We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand.	2.3028724686179514
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas.	1.6582526624613574
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	2.3562952166366085
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	3.2071623813064414
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.	2.4880412767112783
Up until now, the Commission ' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	1.8711452442649812
In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months.	2.5413823164283333
Will you please therefore undertake, before the next plenary in February, to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately the Council has passed legislation, rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list.	1.9860974874639823
That is the way it should be.	2.96393574337752
However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States ' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.	2.945497284689031
Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that "the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter.	2.0852901751372817
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	2.5913174062258117
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	1.9419427382693681
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act.	2.379016236264408
Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti.	2.2305677323288813
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	2.2125675420341
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.	2.866539645669713
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	1.8489802938988114
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson ' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	1.8651316963503084
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	2.5998936835397806
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!	2.486683340994154
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.	2.0138877293323056
This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.	1.84543242736456
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future.	2.0315902912447132
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.	2.0855563439322378
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	1.876387930151355
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	2.692925140841713
The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year.	3.324934395099276
It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives.	1.8330902762394277
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive.	2.643728544355135
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.	2.173351821463073
As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June.	2.43861287612629
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	2.0126693355289045
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	2.1514785917795787
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.	2.7636951412359956
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	2.4201465197504515
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom, Security and Justice.	1.8390356350297372
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt ' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament.	2.6609490896489527
This is not new.	2.917641715677174
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers ' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	2.508678056033736
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us?	1.790145782092812
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform?	1.823342372929839
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	2.2462912625842373
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.	2.6165504952351455
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament 's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	1.858750501819768
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	2.275116156753313
I have for many years, in word and deed, been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia. However, recent events - firstly, what were really threats by the Council of Ministers, then Mr Prodi ' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and, finally, the present decision - are things I cannot support.	1.9320750422123194
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation.	1.9626436758279542
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.	2.4981532268117568
Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings.	2.1797070794814877
Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution, in this ever controversial debate, which is the result of a broad consensus, seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes.	2.6549818599001305
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany ' s defence savings.	2.0465151918286075
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past.	2.1014973288599386
In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements.	2.3878342791697285
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.	2.3183144231499253
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted.	2.6598354751668696
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	1.534372973697244
Capital tax	1.2789122228248213
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees.	3.2665253027412477
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.	2.5848937991877716
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	2.3692963296003957
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate.	2.550075160852761
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference ' .	2.373010916080483
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	1.4094998020659244
The postal service is not just for Christmas.	4.161114302281971
These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.	1.7641220501125332
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	2.40261734574421
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.	2.75414192770031
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	3.021332347854093
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	2.6081799393011895
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	1.9321943404750757
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today.	2.409025079121838
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground!	2.0898772660988185
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	2.894217497843297
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.	3.23189545341096
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.	2.646408992915156
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.442712380239571
In yesterday ' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State.	3.0041243541781046
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	1.9216617329595278
We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing.	2.07834242591689
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	2.312465110015883
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations.	1.9127543744703166
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.	1.9300991706058002
Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers.	2.3909236566435075
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.	2.3842888805092963
And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things.	1.7193526486548691
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible.	2.02153885174458
If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere.	2.8612438680764347
Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.	2.6335491935977706
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber.	3.12406697880171
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised.	2.8567477972958084
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.	4.083794994454576
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me.	1.9844262570513702
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.	2.163342805067706
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.	2.455465608542176
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again ' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	2.190693174007633
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party.	2.9339844754040625
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	2.3555800487833345
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?	2.0051680470758835
In Zambia 25% of teachers have died of AIDS.	2.313857281363952
In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III ' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument ' s impact, which is its budget.	2.0998787035786415
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.	2.4751309450662435
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	2.141962732734417
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly.	1.640042936620057
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.	1.8418923322957481
And people have spoken in the past about BSE.	2.885896884739058
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	2.020600166556759
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	1.994099010869226
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome.	2.306206357179194
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	1.9312214609672727
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".	2.312267537485624
We in the European Union are one Community.	4.257491848310124
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive.	2.072367318765323
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	2.0251678669496695
Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration.	2.002284583765653
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	2.773393030143028
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.	2.0830769644271503
This brings home the connections which bind us together.	2.235519908561816
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report.	2.05854591363528
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	2.735698853629541
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	2.428259571131829
The Union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom, security and justice was confirmed at Tampere.	2.5717426933635155
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country.	1.9922905827908473
It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding.	2.20177252299083
This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.	3.246143762532452
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.	2.577037336622575
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	2.3830332419674236
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.	2.166642211325906
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed '.	1.807169126934869
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	2.930547584095368
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change.	2.578472385985227
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.	2.496096842653323
It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions.	2.677520277163002
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	3.522616810032027
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People ' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	1.956494840030392
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	2.886526661113481
Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes.	1.8910173328878204
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.	2.0458479683375006
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	2.239295301027854
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel ' s proposal and wordings.	2.633045856572876
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.	2.086629067989869
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS).	1.751292305836998
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	2.4294947716260595
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	3.160986452267185
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.	2.2567310132007097
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	2.68462718642359
I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.	2.4490817296894267
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union ' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	2.585049864033894
This applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect.	3.093029298740449
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.	1.935359426017681
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.	2.6832255270201566
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	1.65294037349182
I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.	2.485137677171406
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.	2.6452080490739163
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	1.9996239764033619
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	1.873848468393298
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	2.5318123733082123
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent.	2.6536165552706397
The Commission ' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced.	2.1197917968546145
The Commission ' s objective for the next five years is to become a 'global actor ' by showing 'genuine leadership on the world stage ' .	2.420702010961378
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	2.6677286997490968
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.	2.1600783787291857
These aspects are very much interconnected.	2.838878677647428
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.	2.139879795061689
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	2.358227089561542
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all.	2.361473830621783
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of.	2.366398449091041
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food.	2.6763842810187515
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends.	2.4917564180082707
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan ' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	2.6905229645817785
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?	2.681622308773724
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	2.8222659425226415
As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries.	2.574511321184294
So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.	2.332075343878067
Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.	2.4964730222561644
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	1.7020612634178012
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.	2.0680314571707012
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	2.276982119431933
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	2.9201563630026026
For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament ' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.	2.6808701856776964
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	2.4100960454819997
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn.	2.3572091125832215
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities.	2.244438085713532
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.	3.0183789776471763
Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.	1.596569017917481
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values.	1.945488741423569
In these areas, Europe ' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.	2.3768796847166094
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise.	2.567741920565209
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.	2.3563008954675664
There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.	2.2414134027799375
Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament.	1.8086754293368985
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	2.4926534623629872
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	2.64713401214791
The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.	3.0648246844990346
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.	2.0979798038282964
The EU ' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors, on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament ' s analysis.	3.095440575198327
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.	2.183502011789407
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries.	1.9063870666823617
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	2.5071637004572356
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres.	2.2909714920014643
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace?	1.6971155913331113
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	1.9707702135702014
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.	2.5130353138340165
What is the basis of armed action?	2.8978716090697296
For all these reasons, I think that reforming the Treaties would allow the huge tourist question, which is an important asset for the whole planet, to be properly integrated.	2.5350763815492168
Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out.	1.3706039852646617
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	2.3519600860424803
Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	2.1818593345480854
I must highlight the part of the report which states that, in 1975, with regard to the size of bluefin tuna, a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15% tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic.	2.534165115521335
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.	1.9990661838545398
Report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/2000 - 1999/0240(CNS)	1.5333726630857203
Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland.	1.930314939298724
I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect.	3.648225751609328
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	3.5260489281149803
- (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ.	2.5591088168129796
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	2.2985088768488677
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	1.9232552875919064
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement.	3.453822796442505
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome.	2.0393309080120354
That was how it was.	2.556548065558196
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators.	2.2271518399569015
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union ' s foreign policy.	3.1933496457026243
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.	3.3251595012072968
It was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre, thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible.	1.7628950173203013
The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity.	2.5072944050601196
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.	2.4624499240647406
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	2.9391181623264577
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	3.038445389209823
We are now unable to guide the peace.	2.4151040796949346
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing.	2.743562787751252
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words.	2.180497306098538
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too.	2.21753175233679
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.	2.8040954284049673
Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle.	2.311315128287199
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union ' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.	2.3440570185593272
So much for the first comment.	2.9361019100095036
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	3.1282309195124194
The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women ' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women.	2.561258167490773
That is just the way things are, however.	2.3250216313578562
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union ' s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping.	2.5543799214863308
Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members ' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana ' s fault.	1.9763079476582937
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.	1.9359167927695542
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	2.2480400064995183
I think we need to retain it.	4.28534367435229
We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory!	2.2182517550024405
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	2.8790037504013286
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.	1.8556623444177824
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe.	2.155348787312282
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	2.287130988908321
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.	1.9243531649794412
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	2.0280899082323884
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.	2.1022487879511385
. Mr President, this has been a very useful debate.	3.193432409973068
Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban, Labour ' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same.	1.555860573653281
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	2.318678022897813
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.	1.8409576658113125
They are wrong.	2.598264568246328
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.	2.124971010224721
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola.	1.9504341581812523
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.	2.34635445033922
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks.	2.924145539501746
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis.	2.1105685508780145
By this I mean, of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union.	2.0137637431396924
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	2.2194515617334574
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.	2.0111263337044964
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	2.4021521172552234
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives?	2.604715649881218
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency.	1.6180365696685512
Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children.	2.070327328553032
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively ' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	1.8351025404487962
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident.	2.167287031448256
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	2.3303011132100413
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference?	1.9567885597124204
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	2.979377163735546
The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido.	3.2031421186782705
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	2.0757588265549365
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.	1.7296691092762417
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved.	3.414601422626116
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid.	2.388318590308799
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.	2.653324192652374
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.	2.1026003093906245
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	2.571516121291024
Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas.	2.7418166173367036
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas.	2.095740874220374
If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed.	2.851920916211722
Firstly: a regulatory framework is needed, which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens.	1.704150605461037
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	2.9970204967622545
The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections.	2.436824375955841
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	2.2048814692557217
Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council ' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force.	2.3415300825010763
The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness.	2.3850464833196097
Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship.	2.051016090667419
. (DA) The European project began as a partnership between States.	1.8906043206791143
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	2.5182526927024345
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.	2.1051246514920194
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	2.219407031647936
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".	2.562510555972515
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.	2.626876101806922
Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important.	2.5222497891247166
Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions?	2.516377339195355
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one.	2.8056087486680155
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text.	2.56535045423487
The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.	2.263023954268127
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.833192720718841
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility.	1.4924936614824493
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.	2.854230968248439
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	2.6330043203012847
This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken.	2.274914470035845
There is no backbone, and no teeth.	2.1503259990834973
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.	2.1780790319011065
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	2.347699192301549
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well.	2.0197566241697356
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.	1.9658072859224471
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	1.8988558322288078
Our response must be rapid.	2.3945276478515884
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes.	2.2042724933532445
I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.	2.3295894580120384
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.	1.438445101842848
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.	2.4308632837813478
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	2.7420435478077545
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	2.1383883579572998
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	2.4912913863196082
Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union.	2.422503758300846
I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House.	2.1295046224592973
. As Mrs Wallström explained during yesterday 's debate, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.	1.9400542906499523
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.	2.5973938977109716
We wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States, even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past.	2.849216942921654
What about the infrastructures?	2.9326778768371584
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.	1.4929057708213265
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation ' .	2.158791682155196
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work.	2.262826673991786
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.	2.041159309489831
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed.	2.333368563752855
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission ' s programme.	2.8522395648894996
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.	2.1847791402698946
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.	2.099357001976971
Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people 's thoughts.	1.6227637345112147
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	2.0765371987348633
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively.	2.152321129367016
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	2.8299921690816925
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten ' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	2.13443938926911
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check.	2.028989796020296
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here.	2.9261532434729594
Resumption of the session	1.14747099996588
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.	1.7074670261869813
In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.	2.125103560738254
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector.	2.2942439643669097
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	2.068581285210529
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling, reuse and incineration, as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions.	2.3508384466908034
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.	2.654895797956562
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	2.1887946815098895
There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment.	2.7746377333064816
We should not be so politically partisan.	3.2623873880926517
I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation.	2.794375412417501
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	2.435766500840027
These proposals favour women especially.	2.362883839518847
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	2.307727490613587
In more direct terms, to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams, this would contravene the Treaty of Rome.	2.038425505082649
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency.	2.823680944361693
That is something we must guard against.	2.3736310146136055
No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold.	1.6635158346766827
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique ' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.	2.1794235389403678
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	1.56884139805023
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.	2.342322893456193
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long.	1.3745088741899674
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	1.983252263244882
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	2.7368722427823955
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.	2.0317709132406643
This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area.	2.4648122897835267
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.	1.9346927091741253
I would like to hear the Commissioner 's view on Amendment No 45.	2.647267262970421
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU.	2.96917332884865
Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions.	2.12914748341844
What should we do with the shredded products?	2.711869565252024
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	2.2686601522051313
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other ' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies.	2.589457171022787
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	2.2856207138843745
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	1.9191512379560138
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser ' s or a fitness centre.	2.3891647976753485
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!	1.2770746289424668
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	1.997298030189485
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage.	2.591169743528179
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	2.5217354851392915
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	1.93339471146668
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.	2.710887582474557
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	1.604162867150578
First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself.	2.1776318190889956
Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring ' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse.	1.9715680807853437
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.	1.9452209018867659
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it.	2.1651463595401297
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	2.3105134229871735
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.	2.6255348004395453
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	3.3689712633407627
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.	2.2036171420031514
In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today.	2.4367629616611595
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.	2.755302113932176
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):	1.7571402537602248
Finally, the issue of officials.	3.730736433098337
This is in place too.	3.482879687754844
Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects.	2.0364404798397695
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.3837687333979436
This is where Mr Solana, the High Representative to the Council, could come into his own.	2.3896639410937435
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report.	2.4654940529563847
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic.	2.4141881589147567
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.	2.0685252572671966
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	2.218532487437645
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	2.0951209468557828
As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values.	2.8872827285916545
(ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war.	1.8038876758285844
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	2.028614571268028
. Let me associate myself, not least as a former Environment Minister, completely and without any reservation whatsoever, with the expressions of concern by honourable Members.	1.7778589323054994
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow, not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but, more seriously, for humanity as a whole.	2.0282960297527257
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason.	1.8661859926814273
Action must get under way immediately.	1.5740959670372807
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.	1.398170242239069
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	2.023165562840803
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado.	2.4003240719447136
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments.	2.6151322230119356
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people.	3.6602737243436163
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	1.5275903124150576
Finally, once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed, we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment, as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House. In this strategy, young people and women, training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention.	2.2768083402045147
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency.	1.6575345614666859
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	2.3172955879755937
That is our duty.	2.582078456374931
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	2.104184443590613
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	2.451458401604522
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry?	1.8082053254403774
Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.	2.313781776913615
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	2.409405001640381
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	2.0687615379681192
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable.	1.617421142716728
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF ' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur ' s intention.	2.224791689303367
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself.	2.5464713929806426
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	2.431003504907206
Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily.	1.7322365164783065
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.	1.8735711004425284
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.	3.0944453665257736
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission.	2.571891889228168
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies.	2.554305666886541
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	1.7821076669912626
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic.	2.4152569997673363
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett ' s reaction.	2.108958344616576
That concludes the debate.	1.9043701250864986
This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold.	2.0816417409169152
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission ' s guidelines.	2.514297338605
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.	2.6265261462425604
But I want to add a word of caution.	3.342564426065045
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.	2.554378305923385
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	3.1640793504600704
Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe.	2.2885771569003563
With what aim?	2.6667475731063255
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.	1.8398619082960956
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector.	2.5462380516020606
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	2.100846053143848
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	1.847945028791352
To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee.	2.0532393718021167
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	2.4191020621351225
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.	1.2544823484348593
After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries?	1.8178944534221222
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment.	1.6494323466878307
Since Tampere, there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.	2.142241768137883
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	2.0926712505293144
I ask for the Member 's understanding for this small delay in the Commission 's decision.	3.246118205427813
In this light, I think that the European Parliament ' s role will be limited in Lisbon, but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation, but are unsure as to the input we can have.	2.6349285909302815
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects.	2.4240016849803796
Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August.	1.8141909905155493
Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution.	1.49792133647484
I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart.	2.397189320574627
Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero.	2.223566028586606
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences.	1.8015451701936769
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	2.253178796385125
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.	1.913040840636852
We are therefore all to blame.	2.7985124160529864
The Council ' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law.	3.0933992818466622
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice.	2.408720410399627
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.1974370904773655
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission.	2.2227917533347012
The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.	2.1743670888115343
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	2.136228505770261
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.	3.2620906406327843
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	2.662227017627328
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.	2.618389362009965
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	2.7126833391532377
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	2.4636563784421486
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.	2.462137529950139
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report.	2.619228302643491
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.	2.6079877301630128
The Commission must continue along these lines.	2.7677595139409528
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case.	2.589778315675972
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies.	2.2265028846589114
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned.	2.168203595397008
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	3.9242772909235755
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	1.8892279364112758
As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo.	1.841677009209617
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament ' s participation in it.	2.0801931927859387
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction.	2.532428796707345
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers.	1.9511202159529146
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor ' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	2.2395313062409
One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources.	1.4804521476310315
I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.	2.1464257448813915
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	2.765338523887747
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment.	1.9203802534373589
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.	3.032573265229831
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.	2.7114851261562354
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance ' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	1.7258491516881407
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.	2.100411477660714
If you look carefully, this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets.	1.7487117105182886
We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	2.1111282210264206
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO ' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces.	2.4076005666578433
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	2.004917126104608
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken.	2.818935947175572
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	1.7454529102735576
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	2.190801931054181
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it.	3.6045890426876412
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	2.625872654825371
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	2.0836290532725914
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	2.9585185766668807
I also believe that Parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission ' s proposal.	3.287749592453476
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment.	2.3954388720358804
For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.	2.654753615948486
On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000.	2.8319937698371263
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	2.803542348943167
The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements.	2.3166685160075606
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.	2.8454982847121197
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	2.3740758473824766
It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.	2.3247616072154558
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	2.195823003933216
As has already been pointed out, in one month ' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.	2.008392845917285
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	2.202610286361644
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	2.2399597217768616
The first concerns the manufacturer ' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles.	2.2072096665118535
In any event, the Bureau will consider your suggestion.	2.1904406698792918
(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)	1.6796848717042512
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.	2.8305769625591095
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.	2.0826072614014355
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.	2.241522178481323
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.	2.4071994087892423
The first concerns this Parliament.	2.9623913843377077
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States.	2.155989307066645
I share the Commission ' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	2.5210488642956244
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	2.4022208176970086
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.	2.586625892846964
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	1.8021562109098643
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.	2.60040728657921
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	2.8290092871433785
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate.	2.2035207930153695
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.	2.5170509710536115
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	2.101338546852646
And just as well, in my view.	2.2121476960687945
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.	2.6995894327437555
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled.	3.5391515830072806
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged.	2.15126978520338
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	2.472848452832033
No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity.	2.1320256452018955
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	1.7996495842104336
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today.	2.0535751652477408
Vote	1.5243683169339157
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	2.206598368939502
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN. I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament.	2.38953853792351
In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein.	2.2520895861373234
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.	2.6065917420100106
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	2.4520818551889576
But who defines these tasks?	2.551801348186136
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	1.755318592227654
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.	2.0564856672267746
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	1.8904400028319128
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	2.7299926441884197
It is before Parliament for second reading.	2.6462988792761597
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries ' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	1.6920503505345172
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne ' s reply.	2.485037910158497
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability.	2.168086818018019
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon.	3.0323052077385975
This goes to show just how topical this subject is.	2.396417926971713
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.	2.126423809623566
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.	2.5126760930252097
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers ' money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers?	2.123940130697589
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?	2.141933923299283
We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented.	2.697146150896098
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise.	2.0114021532778565
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	2.5950221764160126
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow ' s vote.	2.5080161965302454
This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail.	2.0851361025134234
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	1.7858719532533003
These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie.	1.9845571210327804
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	1.8297779503812384
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	2.5713301482115742
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	2.505642055560047
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat?	2.1783360705709134
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	2.3031916109311923
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council ' s draft decision.	2.0861957688777877
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.	2.289161930561099
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.	2.434020436207294
We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana.	2.6025212356246543
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	1.5583275026948078
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	1.9279339347405824
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	2.243647908836377
This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.	2.9154916976055327
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	2.488603281056003
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	2.1525204301676526
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.	2.2581401850223224
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.	2.3006672100556624
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.	2.1703036892417678
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	1.9672500634048355
You mentioned 'women ' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	2.5572047231259187
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally?	2.4067069240224854
However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA.	2.257726432638833
However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.	2.5967606653532846
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid.	2.06627328666022
The next item is the report (A5­0030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission: 'Enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment ' [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)].	1.7694445934201737
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions .	2.1087258276405616
I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing.	2.4647701276570384
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	1.9830796474828845
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.	1.9692841946167563
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them.	1.903817877548663
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall.	2.195994801655069
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.	2.676674191041266
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement.	2.3445008925237176
I hope that it works out.	3.2663070218590464
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors ' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	1.9346877574555252
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	2.2358595937589585
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union.	2.770728536951786
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	3.050692471770802
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.	2.559610675924427
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.	2.18220340602556
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.	2.5352340664295197
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.	2.454189031205192
Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated.	1.760322596899265
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised.	2.475305055464277
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	2.1822503312999566
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting.	3.181343277515133
With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.	2.3717679466195887
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.	2.1262079033455366
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.	2.5214231650037466
Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully.	2.2480063617648014
In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals.	2.248838136498944
On the contrary, it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history.	2.3657606524242123
We need to change tack completely.	2.6634806831041353
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	1.4326987946181284
Shipwreck of the Erika	1.799609822646192
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait, led by His Excellency, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister, here in the official gallery.	2.2276695653179535
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities.	1.7588448533754728
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive.	1.8826619637070454
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament ' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	3.2457188020778056
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.	2.3439644518287595
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.	2.1260679622137517
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that.	3.0351983683860415
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.	2.548909552728467
At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem.	2.447723399641982
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	2.0179567893637413
The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far.	2.5951838931065443
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	1.802529655086085
At the Commission ' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	2.8029493548365036
We must be very vigilant.	3.4676170070906287
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report.	2.140754889900938
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	1.9048962472469566
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.	2.2207830140667304
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.	2.400345135290187
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	2.5733396440706477
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	2.5455332037973495
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	1.6107939801275382
I should like to make just a few comments.	3.0849659612150075
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	2.040086033785569
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière ' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission ' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	2.2742553331154958
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	2.554410357229431
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	2.3992118747218543
In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	2.5626259139868774
That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus.	2.972667538725774
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.	2.1967578971558988
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.	2.678373806932883
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	1.6821633756298475
In any event, Article 255 does not, at first sight, allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity.	2.1263789307178818
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn?	1.9460593926659853
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	3.2646171093376433
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	1.813662398686925
At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries ' own policies for reducing poverty.	2.2200354228854033
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.	1.9685959121645757
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.	3.179403290732819
Obviously, he said "the federal solution would be best" .	1.4936048531488546
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé.	2.5032842277783485
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved.	2.3864359215919086
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.	1.796486826419367
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one ' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	1.9767897564192505
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.	1.9925134246245233
In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question.	2.8088249397946137
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration.	2.185866797847384
Both biological and economic information are included.	1.9346036210543798

From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict.	1.8534312062473326
On Mrs Isler Béguin ' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community ' s priorities during the previous programming period.	2.5647111608100945
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.	2.6830374363882816
The last century was marked by three periods.	2.652532500441464
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together.	2.2099694945620767
. (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive.	2.163376460129353
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	1.9657023703009964
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.	2.9319315361485443
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.	2.462287595930434
They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult.	2.06593967962747
To identify the EC 's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community 's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions.	2.9632337363002224
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	2.300040661619872
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people ' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People ' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People ' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	1.963114540978564
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?	1.9826660309823916
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.	1.7672323980372184
In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing.	2.209641726308185
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	1.9663592753355348
The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic.	1.9681383763556994
One can only hope that it succeeds.	2.6008287360140505
Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that.	1.94080645148625
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control.	2.469888725912861
I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.	2.3900034511842465
This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.	2.3020884810589
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion.	2.1153192414379465
The other amendments are unacceptable.	3.4117409732484023
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly.	1.9957183998794428
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	2.176539561338689
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up.	1.9494850493222693
I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept.	2.205838953016237
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.	1.3895173908546956
And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties.	3.303482256478805
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.	1.9224377280598457
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.	2.1430878961977684
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	1.8828676059408411
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons.	2.5123241894054305
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders.	3.5027955765530323
We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law.	2.180508116149824
I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks.	2.64859945437933
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	2.1162769862245674
Madam President, coinciding with this year ' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.	1.8817572602255965
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer ' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	2.379003583610275
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised.	2.4658946014859784
This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission.	2.365033710235561
Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario.	2.2842871155738287
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs.	2.2087249618048572
The funding of activities for the implementation, adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies, particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development, are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon.	2.320474302099642
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.	1.8817210081737799
It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis.	2.325070691969236
There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved.	2.03333271376291
The third area of incoherence is human rights.	2.6723744179764757
Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman ' s right to vote, should be linked to the women ' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women ' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.	2.057613667987965
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	2.940526193168698
In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	2.6173032884584777
It is, of course, a peace process which is finally under way.	2.458045297850745
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious.	2.6278629718548796
Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus.	2.1873252719437146
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now.	2.022251968422081
Can you tell us your position on this subject?	2.227848271401772
You must understand that a presidency ' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.	1.9132423239829395
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	2.475592593921401
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget.	2.116051402748216
It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate.	2.422371716113628
Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order.	1.7644674960420401
In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water.	2.068362673258081
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	2.8204410452881574
We can therefore table only one additional item.	2.524410580747618
I would like to make three brief points.	2.7576310632363463
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA ' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.	1.6747548666309355
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	2.067035926060282
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system.	2.6285813503174635
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.	2.879341422000216
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility.	3.1824113211516196
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.	2.4379487165551943
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?	2.0238789691013683
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance ' ?	1.8013514313127192
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights.	2.77667288259207
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.	2.179675477642666
It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.513661267551843
The public must have a right to clean water.	3.304506752708993
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	1.877636501933723
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	2.4497843134213664
We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is.	2.9264436746374027
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.	2.372809241430844
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.	2.817872120254256
The government of the United States, or of Israel?	4.077020091393782
Let us, in particular, focus attention on the re-admission clauses, which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked.	2.229722811811519
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	2.090297119221627
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions ' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	2.3254809112053105
The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future.	2.2739879528306064
What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	1.8040734775272216
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	2.0182332270563372
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production.	2.821982637892318
One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	2.1088942072539756
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?	2.945166562791385
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	2.2157557443238693
Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well.	2.5815121405010637
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.	2.262695819542725
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution.	2.8541740092394274
The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support.	2.206080373192715
Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000 ' framework programme.	1.6285077260420966
We Socialists reject the liberals ' naïve optimism on this point.	2.1857350967606557
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.	2.594400539871229
The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain.	2.2207200884801
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.	2.2917993850225495
It is high time that we reached an agreement.	2.2912286931326573
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.	2.6871734431573766
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy.	2.4096715790631253
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer.	1.8807638800674904
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals.	2.6718800612543454
The opinion of Mr Sánchez García, addressed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, contained a remark regarding the IGC.	2.5423054754606085
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.	1.9768437084804251
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	2.249866156124382
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	2.174025855624194
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	1.8447889180268435
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	2.6339046100418
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.	1.502566334409456
As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind.	2.183809395878463
I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required.	2.7863409008430056
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	2.089262561376799
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission ' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission ' s accountability for the future.	2.6809845431210713
As important is the fact that Austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	2.662164084665897
Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament ' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March.	2.971211733091633
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government.	2.96138179789416
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said.	2.7249737791796718
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right.	1.7579942789515008
What can the Commission do about that?	2.249145891627363
Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles.	3.4690767614519515
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	2.547085239288912
Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy.	2.4327880940583206
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.	2.0841044607572186
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	2.574505692463292
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	2.4759400158650515
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	2.3792123706747774
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.	2.479787107930654
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	2.3774062312015847
As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets.	1.9713605599128663
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must, regrettably, punish it for losing so much.	1.9842539316703602
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work.	2.489543797043184
(PT) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas, such as NOW, on new opportunities for women, HORIZON, for disabled persons, YOUTHSTART, for promoting the labour market integration of young people, and INTEGRA, for groups threatened with exclusion. Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.	1.7576778314801307
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.	2.3505339172411857
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed.	2.3330084456105715
The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.	2.3479842345651663
You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world ' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990.	1.77956871945955
The Commission ' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.	2.855715245509493
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.	2.8246480756671932
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	2.6692808565248094
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	1.9138536393705836
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time within the space of four months, we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe.	1.9803792157074662
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.	2.2591003243641787
That statement could not be much clearer.	2.981129388033991
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	2.024814352883874
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future.	2.5969940089808374
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country ' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	2.396789669041788
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?	2.7633981473029796
The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector.	2.662007834218625
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points.	2.3906482565880216
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	2.6502657431939927
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	2.953016079038568
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	2.715138663635852
Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union.	2.1277869666150213
As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today.	2.3622744616137816
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.	2.3044269025790727
Adjournment of the session	1.14747099996588
As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy.	1.8575559084676698
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	2.046471537126944
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation.	2.599291855211582
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.	2.6700369971932507
On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway.	2.2165148056414563
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	1.7753579206530934
However, more work is needed on this.	2.3720689418235663
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	2.1770875854920706
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	2.3694780675774347
We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects. The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted.	2.184389949943797
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.	2.5530807385316914
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" .	2.4913628322902355
I just want to emphasise this further.	3.0428246254415225
I am not, personally, a blinkered militant in favour of monopolies, whether public or private, but when I see the results achieved by private firms in this sector I am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service!	2.061651019433833
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.	2.178709152485299
On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.	2.6148241242534875
After five years only four have done so.	1.8054994783138967
I should like to raise three points which for us, as Members of the PPE Group, must be focal points when such an area is created.	2.283497286122556
Consequently, neither the Council, the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State.	2.522044298958545
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States ' arguments.	2.9878165523918065
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects.	2.402409050056452
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	2.7352191581318768
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that, in exchange for the Golan Heights, all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt.	1.8106139873143925
(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	1.7948469487696859
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	1.8329749388005645
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens.	1.6922943228156293
We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere.	2.876908330366179
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	2.356311505151708
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152.	2.6190993147773285
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	2.4647064025604184
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.	2.3170183453403204
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	1.7366111859182918
Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation ' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	2.1537631398781376
As you can understand, it would be easy to do so.	2.5251116560766604
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	2.029332624314058
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	2.554252946854978
I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe.	2.878936571883322
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved.	1.7883279042023705
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	2.482974921370553
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	1.8734394335694935
And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.	2.5728775701064195
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	2.3943525754786723
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	2.0323539836050553
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.	1.9401273331687823
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	2.65502581093221
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	2.0038591649795845
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	1.7259063377811752
Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force. We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy.	1.8928699686519266
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say.	1.6737876683078092
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	1.9806468837038254
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	2.270385205829928
VOTE	1.0850475141586433
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	2.4867571229919987
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	2.0936040634808615
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	1.9306832951233253
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.	2.229313907561819
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years.	2.4993692776756595
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	1.8410073327353689
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States.	2.0877874779620456
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.	2.1504268141333798
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	2.722149161394203
I have decided, in the end, that the most remote regions, to which I attach particular importance, will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG, with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions.	2.237436210893109
Thirdly: the extension to Parliament ' s rights in this context.	2.071092007293873
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	2.671980510656722
When we adopt the Minutes for today ' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	2.1010664673745416
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	2.420505519381995
This has been talked about for years.	2.4346614657749894
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	2.62487314253101
We are to know who is on each committee.	2.6912121657915424
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	2.3046659057609715
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?	2.314730857819444
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	2.4487871298058357
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.	2.4285328992966067
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission ' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century.	2.9183040164086065
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.	2.379656051145186
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication.	2.6637708805307523
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner.	1.8162364465687377
We should, of course, not get overly excited about it.	2.5261727898448103
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	2.05610188691876
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.	2.4172590402204612
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	2.095734181787066
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.	2.7746757744211843
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.	2.1978847400796133
The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection.	2.63722377151874
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	1.8555781381356828
Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union.	2.3312315058837854
. (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals.	2.1980718891610267
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.	2.256128769814954
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one ' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.	2.1919951677681584
We all know that!	3.2126525005996847
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of?	2.0630463259224254
That is the one word I am talking about.	2.509367745195115
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.	2.496132449670081
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	1.9733798264320537
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	2.156505383543217
Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block.	1.9298894279111551
Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities.	2.2721730471070893
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	3.266405977312377
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	2.282508056391613
The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle.	2.378598291837358
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	2.4043172819759424
I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars.	2.879917618324092
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria.	2.883251013531839
In this it said that in a few years ' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	2.419742714552973
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	2.62160675216614
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture ' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests.	2.640560929983979
I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level.	2.867816460878297
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level.	2.350070140572257
The debate is closed.	1.7740673788011627
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support, and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response.	3.1232571452817868
It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy.	2.3244859323431606
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.	1.4999938803075141
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee ' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	2.10502932546679
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner.	3.052104485830441
In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.	1.809506032847752
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	2.5948796836248897
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals.	2.9526311041148947
Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate.	2.160280606307875
The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy ' s objectives and aspirations.	1.8721536853683374
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period.	2.444304957914707
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.	2.342646730910512
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.	1.992448835130661
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.	2.1078512909472455
Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements.	1.8888696897266026
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	2.1561144454548287
I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers.	2.518374877839864
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.	2.446015557362445
The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted.	2.9970238595895835
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme.	2.1717244035148067
Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives.	2.013727996461845
Everything has become more and more complex.	1.9775732705763363
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days ' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals.	1.7650304196694366
I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today ' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment.	2.381799749824653
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.	1.761412917136536
With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties.	2.5040012970032035
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions ' , because that is what we see, in fact.	1.9225796776622237
The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential.	1.8868419429258236
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	2.032098408779279
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.	2.0428162211194865
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.	2.254009997784673
The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	2.1627449595458983
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	2.5981236165259376
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	2.206966327488405
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term.	2.944561991994922
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	2.2615392569668336
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.	2.157647072031554
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative.	3.351586892095606
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	2.4141446224953285
In terms of human rights, this is a backward step.	3.0131890500743594
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers ' organisations.	1.984766849816741
Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword.	2.407431460369212
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	2.611352146071379
This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it.	2.3759032931217394
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.	2.4206726609578113
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	2.6749868469614846
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.	2.138749369174618
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project.	2.4325103340265315
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	2.9705501590239
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.	2.6318508304416794
Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier ' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with.	2.233531845659188
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.	1.936383873678944
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament 's comments.	2.4296154286303504
The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role.	2.4875328650029673
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	2.206582194807232
This is Angola ' s reality.	2.643637945412655
But tomorrow will be too late.	2.528135516893368
Is this speculative?	2.3487117736587835
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	2.3830060473240517
What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests?	3.077196747201698
Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.	2.1062470600746486
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.	2.1613118305808947
In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise.	2.1233952580432005
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	2.2671074919228897
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission ' s priorities in the field of transport.	2.825526839861597
But this is not in place.	3.8439119377355606
We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia.	2.2587340388737807
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	2.453117956242476
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission ' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	2.5136137180128837
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.	2.000516714802411
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.	2.479703372156125
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	2.4347587560383666
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	2.531880168762411
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	2.7929915219358716
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.	2.3097572753529314
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	1.9581174208116519
Mr Nielson, what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy.	2.828405554959565
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.	2.7956113564986422
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.	2.0171451061343144
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	2.0778645280265082
In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences.	2.54505849247791
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	1.9509745769815736
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	1.7486076942176594
It would be the first in a long time.	2.9039245167126984
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.	2.160169654849379
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.	2.790289793820794
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.	2.5360851000863462
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about.	2.0853396471287176
I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do.	2.171586337666364
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	2.5009929131960082
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	1.9697295569542324
In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.	1.8270607081258181
If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.	2.4226007291895053
It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments.	2.463866182308814
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.	2.093971820763076
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal.	3.0888158129681544
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	2.9669628671813535
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	1.9730092142041382
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community 's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	2.1658472284372485
For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion.	2.145024765267397
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	1.456879281694559
Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	1.825554849183121
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	2.1872790561390154
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	2.696412706213117
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	3.051630681599405
We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc.	2.2948805817200078
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.	3.0982345962760953
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.	2.0051770063144896
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	1.9244565909453135
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe.	2.481017135896273
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	2.0700930100851127
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	2.345751705365705
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	2.060560697976469
These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics.	1.9230554262371005
On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.	2.262359548406887
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.	2.520635967135914
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	2.1086660978259966
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union ' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	2.1820591598258696
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.	1.8415524238708194
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmström put it.	2.048289844526057
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well.	2.344485911977624
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.	3.07352924817162
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.	1.73454007714142
In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission ' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property.	2.6431569826682386
I would be in favour of its doing so.	3.6543318757153083
Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure.	2.7049196944226925
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	3.250672740166669
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.	2.223243143655096
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.	3.2251412018451484
We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all.	2.0718901376179613
I say: shame on them!	3.2827011811825564
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	1.7532163819877644
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing. It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	2.4116616699506537
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999.	2.0136121435169283
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	2.1981903814838946
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	3.3672395897514926
It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today.	2.2207199282367056
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	2.0796420452114104
If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure.	2.495647991495962
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	1.9202085967358804
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	3.2336477336488088
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.	2.188804991141112
Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments.	2.152255379084861
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.	2.6185549946483677
Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand.	1.7699417237051525
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	2.8107720171760624
Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.	1.8970508195813356
These are my three questions.	2.2654016447052108
	1.0510108151299706
To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible.	2.059001614048992
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.	2.454778602132391
They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world 's population never making a telephone call in their whole life.	2.0622572829872916
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests.	2.2810698750112195
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.	2.0901579397693464
We have tried to drive this proposal through.	2.4456215905772183
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.	2.63088511774478
I acknowledge Mr Patten ' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.	2.0402083874347725
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	2.817657702799953
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States.	2.7697246085552623
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	2.1174838950894963
Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.	2.158640108074966
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	2.6480476290253705
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.	2.557775651538105
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.	2.64381349554909
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .	2.039657192928141
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.	3.1731969355788006
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.	2.5800276632398886
With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs.	2.176317874466021
On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition.	2.5932330945457815
There is a second issue I would like to raise.	2.8367946951868395
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.	3.065067031202954
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.	2.7011032899889797
On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction.	1.8287262482411402
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.	2.0830732819846367
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.	2.3260772314324822
Mr President, I listened with interest to the Commissioner 's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market.	3.0094609293058814
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	2.5969058424948757
Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.	2.7248112896830032
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	1.368179304488964
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	2.4569012627641293
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them.	2.100234062909152
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.	2.612041565654532
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	2.452984316234817
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found.	2.752209642176192
II. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses (COM(1998) 451 - C4-0465/1998 - 1998/0242(COD)	1.6978831246425097
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	2.6890141888866266
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	1.8323547064089956
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	2.6710954915230563
Danube environmental disaster	1.412604674619504
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	1.7509729909776148
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	2.051282408233979
In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights.	1.9447628210439558
And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice?	3.3854691730978708
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.	2.335767387298902
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	2.1363992153063025
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.	1.7280869002568198
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.	1.8856549095467843
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole.	1.9464109510746734
We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words.	2.786435602087482
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes.	2.1680453818359657
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.	2.2999687080318316
It is just a question of how.	3.535160320861024
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses.	2.342986243980769
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	2.7749838719605298
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	2.248033129373244
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	2.526275008661193
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	1.5972893120913916
Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems.	1.8334282170454526
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.	2.61529411022707
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year?	2.0440829828698783
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.	2.151019272354644
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.	2.267852000313365
In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people ' s suspicions.	2.145294715286192
It is good for us that we have the power to do this, in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied.	3.558581521972509
In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country.	2.509760648349893
We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste.	2.037577262674643
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.	2.6354028697260317
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	2.5299634416923995
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.	2.2544804278767985
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.	2.7884447280365348
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.	2.42402880535457
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	2.51621872454448
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately.	1.7401252591373326
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	1.8121713207303713
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind.	2.8433786352818298
It is not the Portuguese Presidency ' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants, especially those that the European Parliament is asking for.	2.683014355136318
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems.	2.1303141449544776
We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider ' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures.	2.0782071045074746
First of all the report reveals Parliament ' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.	2.947816051431448
Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime, including by Europol and Eurojust.	1.7832204524542552
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading.	2.3672631919821923
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.	1.529402694251807
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.	3.422143355907764
.	1.374839594702952
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.	2.871588602296719
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.	2.3130835169722017
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years ' worth of experience.	2.902503175353176
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	2.2621509484372115
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.	2.3749511361407083
With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept.	2.2497631750130473
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements.	2.233977877677934
We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires.	2.3403511732133553
The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised.	2.9343791780018447
Firstly he talked about verification.	1.6392440533145778
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history.	1.6387309821597178
In my judgement, this constitutes a guarantee to both sides, both from a political and a financial point of view, of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.	2.819210108877845
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	2.5584183085179237
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	2.7583627747816335
These cases keep occurring.	2.598804256353951
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	2.4230969862628426
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	2.1812262449805555
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.	2.3050862867780073
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni ' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council ' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology.	2.7840510333919806
Mr President, peace is the European Union ' s very raison d ' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	2.6384443096964523
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	2.1554546850314087
But there are some questions still outstanding.	2.5197394038753176
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments.	2.115197812579323
Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission.	2.092454092952733
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.	2.412067742441618
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us. We must completely overhaul, modernise or, if you prefer, update this policy in its entirety.	2.1481633916257623
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.	3.3842008599293116
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic.	2.4111171358096954
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion.	2.2433566203114577
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union.	2.5490083461893756
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	2.8338920782238515
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process.	2.083115181797784
As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries.	2.1784941574102183
At or around the time of President Clinton 's visit to China, the President of the People 's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	2.0501963136030636
On the other hand, the decision to delay the second round of talks, initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic, is undoubtedly significant, but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed.	1.946960242568802
Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.	1.6508324814707018
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	2.0041171424855655
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.	2.5768011004744817
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	2.2692047758176774
So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet.	1.8159022877102178
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	1.9184374446027024
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies.	2.33802177403946
Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species.	1.9180810447934085
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	2.568730261423564
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem.	2.3189949176633946
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	2.2003947314941827
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	2.6094753050702
At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.	1.9197669000102522
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text.	2.7102296067074567
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning.	2.4394972441866596
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot.	2.321199254913316
If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany.	1.6478595620811538
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	2.0990102329979767
I support the enlargement of the European Union.	3.1244896975837158
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.	1.8880467673479364
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	1.6509284615033726
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.	2.488287409198637
We can submit motions for this together with you.	2.461862766268194
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community ' s regional policy.	3.35011134594885
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	2.121520249688498
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	1.821798956102272
It is not a lot to ask.	3.403160085909195
For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service.	2.004023486920335
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement.	2.6370688716276542
Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars.	1.9817356284923409
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.	2.615802643997431
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.	1.9982242849627587
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission.	1.8521513281489623
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	2.04936482181302
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	2.681194734443718
In addition, the Commission ' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.	2.113892379744496
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	2.2236845010980812
We have to be aware of this.	3.6836595270525185
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today ' s debate.	2.4735397363008143
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?	2.4216464196288743
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	2.416240545839561
I think this is a good agreement.	4.167864228874916
But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security, freedom and justice.	1.853582811911865
I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001.	2.36096210310296
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?	2.035927186430879
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries?	1.9442505792581357
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.	2.785615606380013
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	2.346348801154485
As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months.	2.2757389459322215
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	1.831518881558155
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie ' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.	2.194974310323946
Secondly, we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty.	3.238459334036857
In Austria ' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least.	2.460746845310325
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	1.8614664712873175
The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously.	2.5769105078037553
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	2.1310789098414897
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.	1.9786253720606741
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community.	2.266716330794711
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	2.2778106773474915
The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse.	2.441070461573317
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.	2.3758456812481406
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.	2.4777688356369096
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.	1.68925642502801
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF.	2.343685554124544
Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal.	1.9621696767376493
I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it.	2.9305691612099287
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.745750118902646
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.	1.9235846199241642
Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world.	1.8250030443276066
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless.	2.214677724200556
Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party will vote in favour of the committee ' s amendments, and of course our own.	2.3135257691352598
We must meet these challenges together.	2.859690235300727
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.	1.9806100421932287
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	3.575983175508352
I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President.	2.159632101367938
A paper this short is a farce.	2.217632508945481
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.	2.519745554082939
A key problem is the time factor.	2.8617945024955698
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria.	2.2828623254926317
Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens.	1.7058392551257489
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them.	2.2421776221297103
In fact, it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer ' s liability.	2.5206084476442236
Students are an obvious example.	1.3400575781778132
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.	2.046816532070976
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee.	2.0958169672805655
Next, we have flags of convenience.	1.4570095567605268
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.	2.23052661752439
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.	2.1172856729090404
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.	2.278322965599577
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	2.7581824776986394
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne.	2.63832369050186
Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it.	2.67678191707089
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.	2.0170005525433723
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	2.5523584955027228
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.	2.4089835992084456
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is.	2.1669894056546695
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.	2.125329132822082
It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.	2.4662157979581676
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.	2.147874009690456
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997.	2.5576921088336704
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	1.9339256793796558
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	2.6110805770585745
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000)	1.337286314457349
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty.	2.1525869282886596
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements.	2.7783588647420183
On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs.	2.101829034988393
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	2.6289781480837817
.	1.374839594702952
It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots.	2.459562116526912
I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world.	2.497909232556827
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.	2.843494916010423
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	2.695135642953047
But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats.	2.0321336423802068
I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be.	2.2354099791146735
Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world ' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe ' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.	2.4543445666538384
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States.	3.1886527913115326
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	2.4359181169637023
We are a group of unity in diversity.	2.8424747288969052
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.	2.493610850336347
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.	2.2690985503707384
But at this stage I should like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and taken from practice.	2.6767626989375457
Amendments Nos 39, 40, 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives.	1.4564627994542834
It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo.	2.2926445946564615
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana.	2.0377287302900657
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.	2.5040067338189425
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy.	1.8992644368341574
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.745750118902646
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.	2.302530343766092
In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text.	2.0861510710028712
But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem.	2.516200576710522
The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures.	2.076681685266425
We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions.	2.1061519514399913
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.	2.0469571219121603
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.	2.921543479540621
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	2.032946181134769
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.	2.273501181617454
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.	3.8428877702161754
However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past.	2.1336915598360244
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	2.4929614312880437
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	1.8676500408524004
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.	2.3189135424812237
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	1.9092465290130929
This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control.	2.219772752694036
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.	2.9614377980240447
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move.	1.8799518078604143
The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers ' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.	2.468772743294924
Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention.	1.7175381534985374
The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation.	2.756254046843588
For this reason, it is essential that the Council ' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.	2.2699946613111655
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	2.7309141515065827
Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year?	1.7115153283357811
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible.	2.3665727248790063
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.	2.5121572183359153
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish? '	2.2899723121847724
This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs.	2.409103799644849
Mr Fischler, I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting.	2.5421336264504935
But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account.	2.946524642189255
Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough.	3.658387889352914
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	2.7527130178861547
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution.	2.2793956467102303
In its present form, the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets, in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them.	2.56518121668927
The next item is the report A5-0035/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS).	1.9511783461116559
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.	2.207101135857364
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	1.7405757234249237
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations.	2.651765811896059
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.	2.6338076806298196
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	2.386852603297518
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi ' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.	2.39016831993195
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	2.6579369798404557
With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination.	1.6659965348091776
Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans.	2.0759169027533666
Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.	2.2809600417338443
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.	2.7448123084260976
As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real.	2.0054869156708826
.	1.374839594702952
This is not in question.	3.1446597110834236
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations.	2.724956012465834
So we must practise selective fishing.	2.055988333792258
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	1.7892492849401151
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem.	2.461974950911468
Now, the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law.	2.8050361725186073
We are now four months down the line.	2.392226201051286
The first concerns women, gender and women 's rights.	2.41194532036733
They must be implemented without delay.	2.1996206696483505
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.	2.478693879637889
We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission.	2.672006938976597
For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom.	2.2180201232990564
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.	2.648560358940143
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.	2.280434561853232
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council ' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	2.089504710194637
The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	2.1943576483600995
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste.	2.3753296262125527
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	2.27484930322703
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	2.37286285150114
We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society.	2.4512049883078966
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.	3.03810369064269
Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration.	1.9364417294795198
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.	2.2883043531756333
This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	2.3991277560194937
Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation?	1.7607916117630857
Indeed, it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too.	2.361054044708009
National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty.	2.3517776734893325
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment.	2.412890377551101
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	2.0965212548057823
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.	1.9371238031370384
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.	2.3394260197307974
If it were, Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which is, of course, unacceptable.	2.6313206023625386
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	3.4367867134352843
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means.	1.8188492142832924
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments.	1.9079973527972145
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	1.7881430577318196
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless.	2.104143286561741
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	2.4242006201556268
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.	3.633617293847005
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced.	1.9851656814623528
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe ' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.	1.9132617729969217
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security.	2.195597019342184
That is what Culture 2000 is about.	2.084953968800465
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	1.804309135104512
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations.	2.5709225560041773
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	2.990196708867623
We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.	2.0770347893946255
We must not forget that people working in tourism, especially women, encounter particular problems such as seasonal work, the need to renew contracts from one year to the next, social protection, lack of interest in continuing education, and reduced possibilities for development.	1.951403073662075
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.	3.356501746165336
And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content.	2.722048335235581
The Labour Government ' s record in Britain is also a proud one.	2.826400002576385
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas, giving it worldwide scope.	1.8001297179223663
However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism.	2.056343650550212
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	2.094304505232564
Finland ' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	1.5839235786752857
The cast is always the same.	3.0673063728201484
What do they see about the relationships between human beings?	2.0722390635524075
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	2.5447407981631356
Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late.	2.269760149594528
At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna.	2.0126327577152594
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.	2.5486723748975235
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.	2.4497006548618874
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.	2.2228440447672067
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	2.864625624941781
It is obviously the Commission ' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	3.0510526413158066
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government.	2.3381042819414075
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	2.701280176654558
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	2.0382662637587114
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.	2.680501634517853
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	2.547759783931764
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.	2.544474507894502
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue.	2.4335859312880594
Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.	2.4367847217886873
Talks in Austria on forming a government	1.4877767843343621
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	2.1152264210235057
Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.	2.108350156852669
However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements.	2.1683135447198914
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	2.7634552969972064
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	1.7425489055659595
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.	2.7668839665022222
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.4511410500885278
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	2.2279346479631124
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	3.134426042853452
Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities.	1.758488919333443
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	3.1467102486750504
This precedent, created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned.	3.292246279931061
In addition to incorporating a new methodology, this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations, on account of the aforesaid methodological changes, and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates.	2.0126798585590255
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	1.7349369757613886
Values should take precedence over power.	1.4299243073288914
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	2.438288830139733
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	2.161264568414454
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.	2.0840338760305785
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	1.7088450970482982
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.	2.7763221347778226
We have three outstanding problems.	3.0735349842189987
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.	2.2628435135693454
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union ' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	2.195390838629372
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments?	2.434536595135019
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.	1.8025821127372856
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.	2.364978279620999
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	2.723217553043338
For example, as they stand, the Commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	2.1622635800325014
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.	2.8638033151525346
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.	2.090936323523408
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.	2.4460024698941907
Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.	1.6825451534223803
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.	2.1470265509646653
We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95, and they have already published their corresponding estimates.	2.2340741820883148
Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.	2.145948410151443
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier ' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.	2.977001957961762
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.833192720718841
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament ' s position.	3.0419663543692015
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union ' s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.	2.9194194532664945
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.	3.0590776622350653
That foundation is clearly the single market.	2.440204873055787
In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" .	1.8093199569157317
How is it envisaged that the EU ' s institutions, which are already stretched well beyond their capacity, can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition?	1.9877649855391712
The figure is now 5.35%.	3.591266370939146
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.	2.9239112129971314
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement.	2.0633749546462696
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular?	3.2259639579151203
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council ' s scope for action.	2.834781797971857
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	2.1694842410651582
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	1.9605453079011506
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.	2.192178782369336
The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve.	1.86344231150238
Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.	2.1875722416929095
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.	2.257886163936255
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.	2.804163688061083
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free.	2.022553384020695
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	2.2936908878172675
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?	1.7856449116472652
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	1.6391669810196574
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back.	2.4380566284245266
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society ' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU ' s control.	2.370575419931169
On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997.	1.6798920456373545
Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis.	1.9877197024354334
Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application.	1.8711595325755233
In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions.	2.494290646531711
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.	2.352385119353055
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	2.5763245151463665
Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.	2.9814809513834257
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action.	2.577079003931368
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.	2.608539842595677
I would like to make one general point on politics. Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact.	2.1218437441028097
That is very much the right approach.	2.771761974578165
This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.	1.9509558545315768
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo ' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors.	2.272552325621287
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	2.5052756061501293
However, that is precisely what is happening.	2.5200457257525635
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation.	2.5259724395090912
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish.	3.665763160840454
There are also courts in Karlsruhe, London, Lisbon, Dublin and Edinburgh.	1.9022079851582412
That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far.	3.0748784830493987
(FR) Drinking, eating, washing, farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it, wrongly, as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource.	1.5047728946711203
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	2.2312373638672294
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference.	2.0188675306457684
Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems.	1.6948841335184703
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	2.325547036751106
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House.	2.2786873162609576
Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria.	2.247800043391012
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	1.634415191585679
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	2.5312992905433607
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.	1.8602520376107168
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe.	2.6382273475785065
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.	2.4395785381971797
Not necessary!	2.445791521848298
I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market.	2.0096363447092744
In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests.	2.7979284513871563
In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy.	2.2497727827732064
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	2.2780752032013623
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	1.9214476539377174
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility.	1.5273230868660974
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	2.7542439849069766
Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment.	1.978404151227864
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	2.0238760491900134
Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China.	1.9235430284757329
That is usually the case.	2.288927594478319
For these are prerequisite to any development.	2.2345876291806257
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	2.3837139570913672
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	2.3152113283745215
Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions.	1.923902659650928
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	2.5901389455838917
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	2.6401910668438298
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups.	1.6350223820466223
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	2.1684425755623025
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	2.272280000889071
First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society.	2.042199674191268
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect.	1.8137910228650862
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.	1.5781061879614773
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office.	2.223128438235861
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment.	3.2060602070963014
My apologies once again for my mistake.	2.337662192158737
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD.	1.9434222975894817
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people.	2.3634719144014626
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	2.2877859006462242
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today.	2.2500559111548686
In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.	2.1841792849923816
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	2.911248879446661
We need public and private investment.	3.2269706029968117
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system.	1.9331915246905724
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	1.7193646566951835
Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.	2.0963982893963595
In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	2.2426696042850924
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious ' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	1.892588082852309
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	2.7742741971416107
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	2.0495373538961643
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	2.559563573007673
Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP.	1.7363814976049063
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	1.99670665392729
For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission.	1.9322656611698208
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	2.349588094663204
This trio 's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said.	1.9312945313210637
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism.	1.9458114425328483
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils ' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	1.9534818911462957
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission ' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	2.958237912917327
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.	2.7122814731978764
I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration.	2.870673487960894
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame.	2.3848236443917115
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	2.315345802589707
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.	2.3722823184122572
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament ' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved.	2.4088202977448203
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	3.730125333694256
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector.	2.580572118274325
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.	2.397185944023342
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish.	2.8095717059141574
That is my conclusion today.	2.3910241276518187
Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000)	1.360633600399656
At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly.	2.597447253361958
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides.	1.671797968409966
Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola?	2.2949122044753634
It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way.	2.520120459283255
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	2.7572098041856985
It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed.	2.589149413667955
I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task.	2.035016589310308
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	2.309211766372852
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.	1.834740254171079
China likes doublespeak.	1.3002960194192774
Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved.	2.0831809218888035
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions, the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime.	2.616064158229747
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	1.7859648325303583
This is what our European 'Culture 2000 ' programme offers.	2.3373563774017394
Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery.	1.8594917870374121
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.	2.5899949387281924
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services.	2.0510323966250157
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity.	2.3742069963085766
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	2.5958776065863236
It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so.	1.9963541080016058
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.	2.3601008593218817
We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group.	2.025377173518913
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House ' s work and perhaps by going down the same road.	2.4736981947313694
Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face.	2.126764548622721
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.	2.470072446760595
Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist.	2.0054990376119495
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	2.6878054143349868
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs Wallström; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	2.560256095512267
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources.	2.185621353649819
The EU ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.	3.520065157536334
As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules.	3.0194077276761884
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	1.9919987358224984
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.	2.24666458651346
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously.	2.262000783474614
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament ' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	2.956630578716544
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	2.7008448774391187
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	2.3022976389729304
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	3.217983208162495
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	2.3006219067433666
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	1.9274778269937076
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union ' s enlargement on our structural policy.	2.628809625085066
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.	2.4421479433986426
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	2.297700460719319
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	2.509055650683619
Questions to Mr Bolkestein	1.6521054402883528
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.	1.7778651983893965
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens ' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	2.721739233801752
Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything.	1.5223332856693803
In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is.	2.2562029702969038
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it.	2.4543038014006777
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.2116930774074819
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	1.4058436773300336
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.	2.8299975449602113
In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future.	2.3208616959210375
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.3996009621046106
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.	2.617101601850211
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	1.387371623866915
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	2.9369683257976558
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission ' s liability as an institution.	3.578289973517475
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	2.795053761656976
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.	3.067910626334621
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.	2.0737012107471036
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	2.5437093141733147
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament ' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims ' families.	2.5182968639783643
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	2.8054051033420238
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	2.2272737486552625
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes.	2.4802334536625317
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.	2.3951008577518693
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.	1.732046408964786
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020.	2.245773738563695
It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.	2.032806305868693
Hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible, which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable, and I have in mind, in particular, the references that many Members have made to China.	2.3694925787886776
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens ' rights - and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty, combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia, and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence, as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union.	2.218802261938156
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.	1.747109137409462
My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women.	1.9744466690660865
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.	1.8983457675141404
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.	3.182597479169931
It is, above all, the manufacturer ' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car ' s life-cycle.	2.4541526709143673
No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50.	1.8310278817127028
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding.	3.1684388801043655
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another.	3.1576604567328808
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	2.4268046990790593
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	2.128903109920064
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.	2.1811252711949343
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible.	2.5062398099336534
What about women?	2.9516075915053874
Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen ' s document on the Steel Aid Code.	2.2142424108143373
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	3.1031919028780677
In any event, the outcome is in your hands.	2.5307580614567224
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.	2.033034161265542
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found, and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of.	2.4586614027088634
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	1.9215723145392731
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers ' in the context of establishing the great single market.	2.3437634839214656
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.	2.983453510396766
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.	2.0933278755762115
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.	2.896974744984263
But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy.	2.765579650091525
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans.	2.196693216742396
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	2.652734506336682
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	2.841990402864465
It is a 'Trojan horse ' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War.	1.9739006835894444
At present, the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security.	2.0696053159194907
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.	2.1661609536646966
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)	1.5540944303769562
However, I should like to ask a slightly different question.	2.708488278594777
Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries.	2.0369128635411964
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	2.475638720813291
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	2.2922816960190646
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.	1.9165780867162014
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	2.2912538866653644
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model.	2.7945157855091987
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	1.8083231023889936
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	2.0815482179940967
The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available.	2.621055197075348
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	2.8340137441657327
The consequences do not inspire hope.	3.031458990197898
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.	2.884173783113928
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries.	2.1248324100656317
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	1.8357334497676785
Even in the tourism industry.	2.406119064435953
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.	2.0105050729045186
Food safety	1.4495542880071566
I would like to say, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, that in its judgement of 5 October 1999, the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer, which was approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and, specifically, with its Article 9(1), which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated.	2.258638789729727
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	1.9644365689385164
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	3.2905662042875923
Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD ' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level.	1.863497526212876
In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach.	2.294724024997995
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	2.1572585220961646
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company ' s very existence.	2.197934741675178
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.	2.144348814702128
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	2.650480948044454
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	2.4014480672625433
In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged.	2.1656021626404502
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	2.3310307296716313
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	2.2925467900234207
During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation.	1.9457859948438017
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity.	2.1404052023476305
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.	3.3967652371954435
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	2.522178849698591
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis.	2.6944202020325645
Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways.	1.9384245805429914
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles.	3.0299094359888246
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.	2.4925635046761903
But we see no reason to lower our guard.	2.309250761178585
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.	1.997854604583523
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.	2.097260553716705
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	2.125901824472817
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.	2.0807577902195176
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.	2.9741316438792498
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	2.29932914911936
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain.	3.0059315391899704
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	2.707865048863281
This report is very good and our Group supports it.	2.7750277906588185
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	2.495891297466684
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro ' s report.	2.121248718574076
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.	2.3023248423331544
We have 1.27% of the Community ' s GDP.	2.9994063563645335
I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution.	3.4907515486754086
On behalf of the TDI Group, I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro ' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe.	2.4359159995933375
Andersson report (A5-0033/2000)	1.3802596534404634
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union ' s aims.	2.30967758377838
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.	2.0700707783367083
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people ' s health and the ecosystems.	2.528801718719894
We all very much share this opinion.	3.0134024979902376
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	3.087929767372266
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	2.495251605198496
In this regard, it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit.	2.4094263470857844
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop, at Community level, which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities.	2.7445095292909123
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.	2.087758996561946
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	2.3375328181567014
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	1.8949390034432638
The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement.	3.1505496045313115
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome.	1.8675985336176015
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	2.0640993512835015
International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union ' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there. I am, to say the least, curious to know how they are getting on.	2.028744354174573
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	2.4547738540157638
As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular.	1.9312717834751798
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.	2.320441338387941
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test?	1.9485259845992422
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	2.239629416524524
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland.	2.3166034036527527
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	1.7000717896132718
