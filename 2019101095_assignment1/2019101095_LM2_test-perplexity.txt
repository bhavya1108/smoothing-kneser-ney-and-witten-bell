This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock ' s reforms.	7493.107236870749
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.	5267.975582346776
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	1932.7995961081547
These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully.	5293.786313657737
Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain.	4494.739801324282
The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted.	11395.211609221076
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation.	5353.389306957406
The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind.	5193.767040462207
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	1470.279959175545
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening.	1457.8840540937013
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles.	8752.180386182134
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.	480.23675627208286
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.	173.79342596435515
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	672.5098008247434
And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health.	5860.823442203952
First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1).	2003.6221355678335
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete.	51.07350962917887
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	5909.308554158273
Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus.	12708.879028240648
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.	4355.832842657291
Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled.	232.21805651745404
Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth.	4476.2684314500075
We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA, and therefore in other parts of the world, and of a sudden rise in inflation.	4108.628529529542
Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan.	232.93786592887827
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	1248.3380036445
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	2315.0619318315466
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible.	1614.235675867747
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?	1179.220349130488
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention.	1184.2042952845813
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of, and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often.	1426.0080737510004
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country 's needs, but also of its policy performance.	4446.364011100871
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission ' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.	2672.985554164275
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.	1407.6922025331157
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	224.40597338014246
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.	1250.1978704026026
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	1646.0602489700157
But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness.	23880.275140027876
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector.	3955.0637637832688
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.	121.53033756750905
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture ' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	3179.946362901342
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted.	2325.2184796842166
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.	8.495671443141628
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.	314.74500393171314
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.	118.54422338795023
All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole.	264.54171278199397
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	2475.2257900006275
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level.	2167.032987613451
This is what the Commission will be judged on.	81.75026603862811
Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead.	4500.2991610580775
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	5860.096800525979
Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report.	123.92376208208793
Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.	25204.764497494165
The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries.	3493.026745051716
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.	2476.168664477563
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	650.6530771759092
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure.	1004.849120304472
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union ' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.	1661.8733101865216
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament 's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament 's other amendments has been retained.	2687.6331326413606
Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax.	8143.580655412863
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):	151.2000039551844
There may be a number of views on that.	80.2055020937887
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	16480.784397340372
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	5741.91273172614
If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you?	719.082068032459
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	3359.5158988539915
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure.	122.2880262915034
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks.	518.0245979623793
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.	2881.667176318001
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	3031.101452478682
The German version is not very clear here.	3638.812688022243
Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject.	27.664285514544133
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	109.59117857918726
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	1087.5292221144055
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted.	12987.294840240414
On paper!	8936.685653240207
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM.	839.9552166215678
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint.	4978.632275350657
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent.	10250.319580861838
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.2250127304577805
We are taking legal advice.	390.0513652858137
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.	261.5771092745631
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.	487.07562014656605
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals.	4434.968470644046
Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.	1902.7698848105997
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	1535.3711611658587
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	4084.1835268712775
Madam President, I did not want to disturb you a minute ago during the vote.	660.3028332218028
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions.	1113.655311180234
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	5685.6739568824205
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner ' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	218.1833496353894
As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation.	501.91125582825697
Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it.	3607.0019855403225
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	177.42963444048573
Of course it is as you say.	186.63856249530969
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.	331.3955861062714
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	2487.5553478029387
The Committee on the Environment ' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation.	2882.721529407701
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission ' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	205.87642221567523
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.	3005.053777434649
Report (A5-0012/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established within the Community (COM(99)0003 - C5-0050/2000 - 1999/0013(CNS)	36.23511178237146
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process.	3254.5618467010077
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water.	5305.35905576929
Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on.	8711.14796983454
	1.0510108151299706
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle.	5561.550371216826
There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider ' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European.	959.6811505882949
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.	169.20886089882964
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and to thank all the Members who, in their various committees, have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.	380.1568530980768
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice?	381.868368533476
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	989.0995525595796
Report by Olle Schmidt (A5-0025/2000)	5330.082890196059
On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.	3784.9890511886783
(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean.	25.163308041541864
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission.	2829.2149517627076
I would suggest that there is a solution.	41.07881101443871
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.8652139024193484
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.	612.2273167356293
It is about a Commission which is no more.	75.9821946834119
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.	6717.133149352056
We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union.	5048.502717593593
Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted.	42210.464158152834
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health.	864.480296259056
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	99.28692621007866
As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter.	65.51818850304501
In other words, social security is a factor of production.	172.7683956965728
Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction.	2579.6056204138363
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	27297.557225263678
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	72.64199922354682
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.	205.1047989003558
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.	195.16728313835515
Mr President, 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council.	287.93554942108284
Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	158.55355922612355
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.	8745.01443869713
We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union ' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.	1018.2066004146261
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	1538.728673130516
The European Community ' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector ' s potential for growth and employment.	1131.125362621157
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training.	3861.064580968983
The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria.	11260.535560050725
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.	490.4166300345904
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.	5998.3229567674425
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	3344.0754433857687
We need structural reforms in the European economy.	996.2717292344983
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.8025257316374503
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives.	416.06162917669906
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women ' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built.	5624.390391639656
So what was done at Amsterdam?	4882.124404613768
However, more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so.	12699.887934364346
Firstly, for the single market.	190.67323506249767
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it.	566.2817326188485
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	134.4214306251451
To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	59.670955330260796
We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition.	3825.468532373618
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature.	4276.293411121725
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.	710.9802291580871
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	221.28109691121534
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	612.8300618589046
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report.	6204.969447583633
From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs.	4101.275494766614
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree.	5603.7633066385115
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	1263.4229059638426
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	217.25655184014968
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	873.9019555407394
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	4145.828958516277
Resumption of the session	1.14747099996588
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	2891.2129252114296
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.	105.08713049781443
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	1800.418010816747
As for the peace process in Cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations, I would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two.	338.1094049903991
Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse.	4609.954450708218
All laudable stuff.	2005.9125254318008
What should this global actor ' s objective be?	3959.2146781625847
The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been.	1065.0282662177178
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.	2249.9203242905733
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.	4682.865856964776
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.	2079.479908440915
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	6707.309337623181
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	4652.019084464673
Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.	3696.0906253787844
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	26140.88424253863
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.	2124.7324133591783
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	626.8386690233574
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	44.49159657745253
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	930.2508371454027
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	2.224662003218159
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.	384.63782339675055
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	29794.478398358762
As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.	1769.371248063963
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	1472.7737345250523
Are we naively to grant 'freelance ' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?	22262.667192972138
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.	9644.947102242455
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years.	1109.4710459243572
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!	8802.268102434056
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	4247.820718828086
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	378.3620287205047
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.	5579.807646677687
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	339.36374747273555
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	1801.8852910981896
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.	2438.4904018643206
Europe ' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military ' role of the Union.	930.0504338320559
Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice?	1716.8247943868143
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.	2881.380814233344
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.	974.2738849833494
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	1340.4535726697427
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.	28896.004512866708
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	7458.634918032321
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	618.5129186748238
Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.	5897.461195140461
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	10139.826968906067
This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings.	6448.670898456839
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.	434.0815210071907
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!	20637.833415266934
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation ' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague ' (p.18).	22964.81832413826
- (FR) The Commission ' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear.	146.97924837114155
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court.	578.5978400524099
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China.	1654.0982373839495
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	3364.1813734163634
It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned.	1789.071313410647
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely.	3477.8642444645043
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO ' s unity.	6010.119139956471
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	4273.671501401634
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.	111.24390080646663
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state.	1465.9348512466422
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs.	8014.103252070586
But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated.	1456.900917945677
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	244.1918603456449
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner ' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region ' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	1681.1607689973755
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.	5015.26165041016
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	12567.460959006745
The Commission ' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts.	421.99777389155764
Report (A5-0034/2000) by Ms Stenzel, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States establishing the guidelines for Community Initiative Programmes (CIPs) for which the Member States are invited to submit proposals for support under the EQUAL initiative (COM(1999) 476 - C5-0260/1999 - 1999/2186(COS)	1385.3520480877844
I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly.	9858.521309192707
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	109.34387139596924
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	3001.4357411392402
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.	2752.641200625074
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured.	10624.903379133844
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.	1610.657612502594
I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York.	1304.0387867449742
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	164.4257996681643
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.	52965.58524247976
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	335.7744330771954
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	173.30359553848353
.	1.374839594702952
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come.	316.04901392251764
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	3066.2940784478596
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	394.63137728801814
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.	365.78595913168516
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.	284.2652558930615
In this regard we strongly support the High Representative ' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo.	1943.406214573483
There is a need for more coordination, more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided.	907.5427075077105
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water.	265.4192919875432
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event.	1080.3577968621335
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	4844.9027583308725
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	3419.9228579161204
Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state.	3987.801779632407
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.	37319.00046429517
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.	78.38067623743109
But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget.	95.47048815848139
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	13033.322855291432
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established?	1092.2312373388443
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	2305.4970673976804
Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise.	16557.1491196795
Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment.	956.5036374651103
These are the modern means to be used.	158.85968640958697
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	851.1688350553807
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data.	92.55725946416909
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other.	2061.9673193722306
Ladies and gentlemen, we must challenge the monopoly the world ' s speculative elite have on planning the world ' s economy by remaining outside the tax system.	3265.605065945924
And a woman was elected.	289.0604453414809
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	3215.6488521282076
I want to refer to the political position here.	61.705259855486034
During the previous question, we were discussing electoral issues.	1622.7510876105848
Madam President, I am totally appalled by the Commission ' s, i.e. Mr Bolkestein ' s, political ignorance!	2478.991240203189
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.	1409.170636162703
I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament ' s Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair.	49.06190398292977
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law.	709.8440047823921
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	2649.9947662088907
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.	7213.312939469611
Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this.	1676.393214438925
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	34211.62105760004
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	250.79111517459356
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria ' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.	3111.2150796466444
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	1372.0297997791508
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights.	5112.014092412005
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself.	1591.684285987321
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	4444.57932274323
In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic.	288.8568926319346
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.	15586.956877205797
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union ' s development policy.	441.9727304005397
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.	517.5429295528586
The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO. This was intended to be proactive and, using a regional approach, to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population.	4773.657583197772
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	12132.14215197236
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.	22772.62168089673
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake.	5387.323153258512
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable.	2232.7445775387732
- (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy.	512.2227883750617
So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.	1516.8411476569245
Furthermore, I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention, and the fact that, following extremely complex and difficult negotiations, we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit.	10095.732463419274
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	328.75690275747377
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	2737.9535004518507
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.	968.6937382722645
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!	2787.5802874698184
My second question is of a critical nature.	57.82692352059528
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank.	2822.520348003684
This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.	1554.431942451966
That has only happened recently.	1194.623320875674
And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned.	5597.837364657738
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	1889.822017425447
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol ' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.	904.8770490487663
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information.	1509.2085745342654
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	21477.144734085545
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.	691.1399750323836
How will these people be selected?	4695.937279087131
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	2980.7738781408534
On the issue of Palestine, I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement.	539.3001827343123
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question.	846.2365666147039
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.	3455.269539465737
The common position is not ambitious enough.	82.40103409341017
Court of First Instance	1162.6776979487581
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.2915914988009587
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.	861.0651024954225
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.	27.13362025198835
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.	5001.027417019874
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	1473.210049507151
In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation.	207.5113951351098
The delta of the Danube is in danger.	6209.332545110756
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.	556.0262479732247
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others.	9260.070458304515
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	378.8987683478517
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer, more just and more secure.	813.7678743415455
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.	379.02707726922074
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	3188.6809528597005
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.	705.9978798632478
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	629.5975746044937
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	1175.650738066239
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo.	1562.230013272327
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source.	17550.615514003464
Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.	3275.732245617427
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	4917.25580475106
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal.	141.97997502499746
For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.	9902.940540712712
In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use.	936.6774160475728
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.	1086.072778343717
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.	10885.068356904994
I took the punishment that came to me.	1805.6566106725095
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.	2050.6608015437337
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.	149.28315521858076
First of all, many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality, and increases poverty.	4139.366711682608
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.	5088.080585170724
However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.	1824.932450319158
If this happens, the United States ' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.	2977.661795520512
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	493.32914682902066
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	792.7509397251021
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.	1296.7142139803136
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.	3586.76181567105
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market.	1266.9441738659457
These and other specific measures included in my report can, in my view, lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster, in order to promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium-sized firms, particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour.	5839.033116574467
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.	2904.3722249589623
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	2033.0932342054039
ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals.	8829.325940994095
However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency ' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts.	1276.0097650689095
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament ' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU.	2407.3479376683936
When will we debate that?	171.0702667816615
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track.	3710.6625731556906
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.	1065.9750700014024
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe.	123.44478000409217
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water.	7017.157329990577
Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	10373.81408840865
In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament.	3078.8429282221523
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.	4878.38854975751
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	4382.772365488522
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	246.57705318793435
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	2329.3677476860566
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.	1815.7244450933304
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.	5195.285800380889
Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs.	27694.467192290154
The following spring to mind in this respect: the systematic collation of documentation and information, professional forms of observation, the development of information campaigns, the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned, a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy, such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like.	18817.368868825946
Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention.	3602.2377018440834
I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region ' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.	1343.2924891895254
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	1386.812694416166
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.	932.8323289542564
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives.	4430.6214981663525
We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht.	1417.6253060700012
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	4603.785223144079
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.	947.9595580103605
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	2540.688425980762
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	16233.21271285256
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage.	5039.044386386211
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground.	4470.011417643894
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	4418.225721551656
Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment.	1502.484512426407
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.	519.637843959256
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.	163.44932104259982
Tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage.	6609.786945097067
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well?	261.55008897652544
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention.	1999.75091343901
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.	766.5252969047447
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	9231.934173208043
Negotiations will start no later than 2002.	3474.3140000663875
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	544.976733844489
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	2667.480207400389
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	285.6687856047955
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)	70.98978349261849
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are, in turn, generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious.	20694.58814269499
As for the EU ' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children.	274.4839293322686
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	1624.2861797689084
The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.	28.059315510029826
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments ' ability to act and within the scope of the Council.	923.3909424741929
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see.	97.48926090461815
Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message.	10319.196860699449
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.	597.8024939251314
Mr President, I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up.	3358.155229275999
It will become totally invisible!	1295.0709777497561
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund ' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.	1546.8292689092434
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union.	4756.868166793335
The Commission document too, which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon, takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas.	14551.926410355123
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy.	767.999346972737
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it.	698.2978724447236
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!	701.6100430446832
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	891.3014640782723
We have made our views very clear to them.	464.803817631248
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed.	1.9530194356855066
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).	10000.00000000001
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	363.2552175874356
The ÖVP (Austrian People 's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	7374.994135414926
By pitching the percentage level at 5%, which is now likely to be the case, it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage.	2443.3404428684958
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	67.33657556060811
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.	153.91156414165866
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason.	52.176232927311645
(Applause)	1.0297836519842112
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.	1206.0423574597103
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility.	4296.257183767041
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	1878.0695389232933
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	2350.99650646987
Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work.	1541.212368912337
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources.	1194.4507508774927
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive ' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business.	1270.263895669826
We must emphasise Europe ' s spiritual history.	1173.1972562421167
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	11071.669725892267
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	315.407594302814
This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme.	10860.076607422903
Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit.	2689.9261078964064
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.	307.22276935713114
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.	14.406391057012856
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?	2701.8950149717007
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.	2088.062525226826
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	3257.3208661356034
The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.	4077.7453209312816
In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers ' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union.	2256.351936478366
Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole.	1973.6430095645887
According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations.	794.037872466569
Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!	2032.16862683741
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	4840.493794476886
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.	714.5859855641216
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy.	769.6725001396588
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	4249.87303971322
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.	2927.004817830099
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	625.7133303747748
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	1956.2983047000653
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	6479.059665928791
Yet this is not the situation.	73.75335640004995
- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.	2225.9876459695674
In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives.	3801.122815405328
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.	3909.178891130932
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards.	701.6587529122256
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council.	14.214724557839203
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	302.4135968566353
Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.	3014.937234862895
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.	13273.229963311678
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .	3016.1060145791025
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.	8834.932804682203
I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks.	3559.819683350639
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	917.2866951910646
Leopards do not change their spots.	15793.416071863045
Mr President, we should like to request that the last sentence of Amendment No 2 which reads: 'also calls on the Member States to promote tourism for the elderly ' be incorporated into Paragraph 25, which deals specifically with social tourism, after: 'tourism for organised social groups. '.	2983.8794672348035
But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided.	1882.177896167666
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years!	2139.556252529444
As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed.	2577.7961947660815
However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle.	5905.967059009838
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty, the end of the nation-state, and so on. But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France, including British student, Isabel Peake, who was thrown off a train, shows why we need mutual recognition.	5510.606536806216
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.	1348.0231866828121
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years.	5269.431540990938
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now.	2000.4322454695678
We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.	2499.113494852136
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	5173.377840137287
And when that day comes, it is too late.	104.04290422439651
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years.	2153.4972188781408
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.	5027.651090729231
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger ' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	554.77349585788
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	5261.3098068995005
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.	192.93993810136925
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	15865.611666878665
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	880.8928662658828
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.	46.68319478878243
It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.	5090.347840564812
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	1168.818269762329
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.	1136.938352413304
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	9382.64424014007
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.	2.32540161603256
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal.	1330.2084224575356
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.	4284.3737271500795
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy.	4684.1065991178875
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	3641.1935305808684
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government.	9163.30968405472
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina ' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.	3901.17411845735
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	16705.387088425276
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	1787.8625273547302
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	460.59986078217247
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side.	4463.8100368932355
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy.	2780.128980554882
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.	379.3012822005715
Mr President, ever since Plato ' s 'Republic ' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	7143.205967517743
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	14007.905336069849
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.	2573.9835649835795
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions ' way of working.	484.9746811278896
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria ' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.	8487.984699477669
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):	2179.477243384206
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.	886.5510216107089
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone.	9873.88235971343
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.	389.7931992093205
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.	79.6880319953166
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical, realistic and also achievable.	2195.38425621603
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.	8414.55517722749
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	8268.692513908723
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	1008.5034007773572
In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?	1860.5323647161952
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	178.61394903268868
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	19.29481836122441
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge!	6136.286839284025
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	16010.101235278951
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.	8032.364791608036
However, the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar, and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions, priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice.	591.7462130627639
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	393.4184964412938
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	1673.6926533695657
There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific.	958.6780156042981
Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services.	9379.754540291258
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	1672.254968957607
Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.	22881.440789159104
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	26618.72377906425
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.	983.2298029969829
Instead, communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems, using EU resources as a value added to local actions.	14687.31221471265
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	1.582408929381203
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?	6201.173352892402
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it.	279.55330943641235
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system.	504.5246780157639
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes.	577.3207261008854
In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax.	43.02147535606991
Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen ' .	2602.808173917042
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.	9689.444014216871
It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place.	798.857746628719
The ACP-EU agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption, by sparing those who are responsible: when will sanctions and controls be imposed on Total-Elf, which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the Congo?	6327.493547772642
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question.	249.9718796053385
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment.	1713.8467462173046
To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons.	10263.719939746486
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	92.53992510734558
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.	885.916003217918
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	101.54599527961028
This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection.	2418.930751837497
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.	1524.2714125195535
In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said.	1079.1830111403754
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States ' national accounting.	4505.473104127075
We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens.	674.8907274253083
Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur ' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget.	73.10528023629193
Scrapie	4886.18048357582
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.	452.8004465896466
This is a major task.	96.00141238620681
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	7402.748648028992
First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague ' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.	265.0419716041028
So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans.	463.9850078411734
My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support.	418.98818738888195
Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively.	144.58324327622992
No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself.	12.475091232245937
Is this possible?	131.4036114748495
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.	2117.204122715433
The same applies to European air traffic control.	464.3657120838112
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	12613.016721200607
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.	984.3632401849435
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.	2442.258022828909
Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.	262.92000974869137
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.	464.66831670111736
Many of the general points raised in our committee 's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan 's report.	1184.6881417277243
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty.	1915.4555991689483
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution.	2358.1143216361193
That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us.	1953.4019760593396
The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.	3661.6662588705635
That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.	760.1022211853189
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	2332.6229495477396
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	706.3137464659751
The objective is of course to create, first and foremost, a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified.	2211.5593681646683
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade.	1420.6124941819216
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	7615.26691592649
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	5836.501138563712
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers" .	132.3512454326888
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	4739.652856954902
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend ' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	1222.9593703029807
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.	207.0572189367038
They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	3474.183907186228
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process.	6094.123366362906
However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences.	5468.115664111633
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.	2631.1262021530624
I consider this to be unacceptable.	3.774418185911655
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell ' Alba ' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet ' s memoirs.	4910.2480677128015
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	3712.8900073276955
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.	13773.118372769255
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	1449.8511078766378
To the rapporteur ' s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors ' legal position and impairs their legal protection.	3761.3145294885967
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	739.7526593675116
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	1182.35034627696
(Applause from the PSE Group)	1.2204981788506526
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	3143.3703032404646
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	1782.464793672769
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.	796.032560462764
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	1925.395459225557
I want to emphasise four points.	192.10436850970672
The impression that Africans get, namely that they are inferior world citizens, is not unfounded.	35562.29665542676
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.	1290.7941010873965
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	2668.2972595445635
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?	6380.103006572131
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.	40.19535530478285
Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important.	279.6408745292941
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.	1382.096265830967
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):	2179.477243384206
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change.	2898.5617959430174
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	6881.522832543868
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	1225.4823303605626
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	1103.8677800308458
Finally, a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report.	521.6305526984899
I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.	365.21786581772443
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	6212.39919553586
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued.	7430.860561841645
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.	2234.369934208394
But what have we seen since then?	2474.2932625119156
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends.	314.87141898696996
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	3995.1890456946317
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States.	5661.368670985283
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.	1991.2959104045426
It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible.	9390.950972880275
It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life.	697.1139937549138
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.	7976.267893764944
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.	590.7280272714585
Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment?	1893.0034598968373
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion.	3461.497401240764
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	388.6395564363649
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable.	20283.6563897899
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	5482.3427757201025
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!	2589.3935247678896
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.	540.9701278875197
So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented.	2538.1642455649458
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.	763.7968622940175
This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.	3756.357364111255
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	547.493424966227
Indeed that was the idea behind it.	796.3399916676859
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks.	6007.252700605203
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	1100.5480553259574
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.	674.1430748323718
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.	13426.621156455103
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite.	10893.640196051583
This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated.	4959.2118138865735
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months ' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands.	5279.231582091773
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.	12565.403176866099
You are most welcome.	393.70835348626923
Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.	2947.3462352016163
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.	837.2898879760621
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	485.3430811377286
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.	971.0954013296137
It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe.	3810.5183364529285
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology.	1370.167151442523
In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	761.3934087032102
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative ' s policy unit.	9854.74599845479
Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):	159.01413871350013
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	4135.881689561283
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	2248.800446266498
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	455.73074972417874
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur ' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	819.3620395383392
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	2948.123673871342
But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation.	1561.724017120414
This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47.	5764.069808686426
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	155.7525028022756
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	128.12812691272399
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	602.8763620086271
I understand what you are saying.	453.92021622738355
Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely.	6671.189314485444
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.	1923.5343118642368
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	229.73182279258134
In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position.	635.8798990541089
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety, for example, are nonsense.	5334.127976884457
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	2312.307758450271
Storms in Europe	371.7005719248615
As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health.	3311.2370345476247
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	904.5536374117926
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented.	3798.039365313358
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	1319.7659479642623
That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks.	689.2887904510025
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?	4799.098049786617
I think we need to seize the opportunity.	236.88919406001543
How can we do this?	53.18989469033477
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	1139.0757723068193
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	3118.4024880657007
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky ' s life and freedom.	6984.8078344715195
The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.	4648.957054512769
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	310.5782832327071
I would welcome more concrete information on this.	695.9896877746321
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	71.63039148666512
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed.	4076.4225471006907
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	1642.5679326489799
Madam President, there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union.	95.37273146053353
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	222.28538073064186
After years of 'good and loyal service ' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries.	1845.3346727635783
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	2818.938919483017
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts.	8594.786837807707
In relation to Mrs Lynne 's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	1609.068523413002
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.	878.0392358596721
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	3153.3345754575303
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox.	1959.5066726754612
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute?	10759.199295450244
. (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.	1188.3551739690236
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	1422.2606293406075
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	3682.8281740202297
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	469.58849652200115
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	6785.374049643152
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that.	6542.825732709583
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	2536.878529862906
In the meantime, let us support this first step.	1831.6560394408996
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	1496.102056480762
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	5530.986191570488
The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107.	851.001007327166
Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.	372.89487275373017
The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions.	1783.9832250787451
Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission ' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.	440.83065470521177
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.	8179.674868200561
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.	1198.8027518949557
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	15.320764740737076
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.	4549.060898864876
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud ' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services.	1941.2394503874848
, rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report.	10031.25137545507
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	391.761526536585
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment.	821.5289133387653
Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles.	4097.6462181679235
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	3848.938250095414
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	15857.548510949944
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see.	429.95397172027555
Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future.	4818.877807653318
As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase.	6036.404035881876
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.	3363.504725955841
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.	1505.978496614781
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.	2019.4155855065537
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	14.289292959826618
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point. Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.	288.452664665929
Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion.	9818.804026243202
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	4815.238813877897
On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission ' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds.	354.58159084060355
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	2047.6374042216498
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	2219.050034366328
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	1241.5357816358323
However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.	765.5881172213724
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997.	10531.719427853928
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	4202.5888397662675
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.	477.63074744842646
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.	3716.8429720468466
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?	413.65992662967585
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities ' (UCITS) can invest.	2826.6466609154945
Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.	929.9513958561239
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations.	5796.106135887314
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.	464.92543651408664
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	25776.24501536337
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	3040.6835808956425
It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission ' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions.	167.9466631349731
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	792.6311548438221
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements, which we must solve.	653.2645857374597
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.	101.4557145331224
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	1407.5742303394034
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all.	621.1997426021169
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	9165.873435016178
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.	5180.411741494645
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	671.8060331243579
It is clear that this model ' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays ' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences.	1352.2771465846415
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.	12227.244055663099
The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values.	2986.451619803626
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	1.9250115121496645
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	355.5172685003598
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	11362.235816779246
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.	8157.182504137687
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating.	1810.6658819647303
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	6451.324431883285
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations, will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.	1023.2120992438022
We are familiar with Parliament ' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council ' s legal advisers.	300.8190535255994
Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital.	2315.9129887303166
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	2759.3278187749906
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.	214.79419969816544
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions.	2919.711615177212
Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.	5450.896767314199
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.	12654.15528651974
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	107.71631718961831
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	14006.305687175243
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.	2959.5139545320553
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	9431.379389683749
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.	760.1928124972977
There is a limit to how useful that is.	603.8589271478032
After the debacle in Seattle, our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty.	4189.488597842664
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.	3113.854998879551
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers.	760.4695777617426
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	642.4281371162806
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba.	192.92017342531213
(Sustained applause)	1000.5839789093858
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	1511.543115860365
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	26783.52334084223
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	12506.250527972188
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.	201.1516536097777
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	8190.96498281012
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union ' s credibility.	2178.346935739261
This directive is a contribution to this.	102.86094997017273
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	523.8243382873492
One example of this is the 'Celtic ' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.	3631.4971801487973
When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish.	1819.7243981096024
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	872.7052405545447
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.	130.23252994067394
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens ' rights and judicial cooperation.	148.92615882745395
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	3485.919175376414
Resumption of the session	1.14747099996588
We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.	4687.333425571475
How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe.	11708.744641180832
All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.	3366.8878379707703
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.	112.94034398400119
What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action.	5868.359772983764
Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000)	14677.992676220701
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	818.2710808744175
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	4414.609739474732
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.	3224.1325720137347
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	111.2291350975499
Is this simply a political gesture?	1521.224473529366
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.	5400.986001909205
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.	1144.2232821146363
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.	44.636863581293554
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now.	8318.76601588219
The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means.	8221.198966248898
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	5792.973892587939
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive.	1606.6764744742243
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well.	619.0616382911877
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	307.2314170961747
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau ' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	1480.3805626367314
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding.	19038.83822859334
I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions.	1644.7565346122851
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit.	11437.897382650566
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.	11435.36918121623
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative	38311.86849557279
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.	3.9332082491274716
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider ' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.	3099.490474249685
Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version?	2066.2287302231584
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	16196.321384153243
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	1214.9064555572352
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament ' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	1653.9065285201361
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.	2354.785951705487
Thank you, Commissioner.	1.441771292412813
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly ' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria.	169.58809185508267
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977.	12879.85642340954
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	5512.336752379514
The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship.	1409.2080178634956
The first key concern is independence.	2174.522051395889
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	5220.601385146698
It is equally true, however, that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II.	1488.194944316185
The Commission does not have enough staff.	66.90513282615643
Thank you for your reply.	1.8799470643006613
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	35656.28105777173
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union.	148.28481052277985
We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective.	2973.743448930386
By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty.	8748.003340542868
Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO ' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment.	3040.7266237496815
We will need the European Public Prosecutor ' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	880.1123990497057
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.	649.1643388986757
We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.	6977.220301226429
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	2076.5250125671587
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	14677.992676220701
Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i 's left for me to dot.	940.2230066898688
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	740.7151630078228
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them.	916.8012398330542
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	415.1316460991211
What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years?	2781.6012638544757
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.	3818.833526099969
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?	5116.394482911873
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	708.4223659257609
Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand.	1087.6825255623594
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	586.8866911691177
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	2127.3334912479345
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	1578.0228029994114
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	12474.404953542193
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	1798.7262141888568
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	324.88762008383645
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	875.9909195276568
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.	12476.449464755868
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose.	5149.1173311893135
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	12030.269176687809
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.	2532.0117149958323
My second point concerns the safety of these plants.	268.1539721435418
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	2111.0832057330576
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	9118.195180829849
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?	181.85030282084227
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.	8236.510389008668
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied.	2313.9060885437966
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.	2531.784989267586
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?	11170.349228082814
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.	26398.073479183397
Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, José Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another.	8611.434122638962
Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	1208.5832199379759
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	17279.733606708378
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	4499.228799744223
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?	549.240823202058
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	91.90387967166728
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	475.4041276470626
Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually.	2548.86295154409
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order.	2293.273802306986
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	5304.812299408476
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	389.2194803229678
The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.	13.431962092254812
The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year.	2347.5271985233035
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.	1990.1223645942205
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.	4017.6282906269603
Resumption of the sitting	24.21325218591483
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	222.44885963795747
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.	1214.2629153938121
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today.	14846.48359986855
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.	1132.3746639149167
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these.	2176.116284225384
Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies.	3619.1706132703944
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).	17766.642148735267
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	1033.1720215540292
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM	2986.698207826615
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference ' s agenda.	1735.55940108451
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.	409.769745186215
85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is.	2665.646976867746
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	607.2790813232422
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission ' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.	988.0506796665422
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia.	409.05364714086045
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.	55.309450647253776
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	45.2987765607809
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	1089.1584793361417
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.	3939.3899829164357
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer ' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	924.0670449057059
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences.	321.7990988705259
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	6945.328203094733
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature.	1424.305999840145
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.	166.5293830125577
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.	2414.464740646806
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.	2438.7005411961054
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies.	1218.4481040723995
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States.	1259.279080545603
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	892.8167520064374
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.	1139.0825236736046
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	2212.314310704201
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.	2483.745155887789
This first step is so important because of this model function.	3322.19520670751
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.	17534.73783065473
But thank you for your remarks.	919.0688678969557
However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation.	1017.7360145772335
Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function.	1313.0258542320066
I believe that today ' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors.	1128.0801497096318
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	1404.5584105414844
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage.	550.1685691365482
Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist.	688.3376133393612
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.	5144.685791884307
